Beatriz. A girl in HiSchool. Sunday church going, god fearing, with moral integrity to spare. She is also a beautyful, pure hearted, innocent, greek godess cyber angel. Pfff! HAHA!!!! She is a morally ambiguous, chemistry master, super genius who made a contract with Pedro to give him drugs in exchange to his participation in experiments. She used the respect he has for her as a leverage to manipulate him. After the experiments she put herself through, at 13 her T levels were so high, she had grown a.... thing on (now questionabbly... her) crotch. Is able to avoid going to doctors by manipulating her parents and avoids needing PE in her average because she is just that good at everything else. Did I also say she is 14?
