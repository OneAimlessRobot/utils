Built like a very athletic high school kid. Currently, has visble abs, lanky arms, and really strong back and neck muscles.
Trains like a Mechanic. "Do I need big arms? Lets grow them. Do I need to work more on my left because currently I look like the fucking charger zombie from left4dead? I want to go for a  cycling race. Lets allocate more for cardio. My opponents... I cant stop my opponents tackles in rugby. Lets do some carries and situps for this week. My legs need to rest. I need to work on my techical prowess. Tactics dont do themselves." This
 was before falling asleep, last night."I thrive of despair. I dont know who I am. Neither do I care."
