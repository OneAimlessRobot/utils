Hello! I am Mafalda!
I jot down my ideas and best moments over here, to remember them.



I have a kickass story to tell about me, about a prodigy manager who is offended by the oposing manager mid game, decides to force the referee to let her play to teach 'them a lesson'. He lets the manager, but then, although she feels determined and willing to defend the honour of her players, who just saw her as cold, playful and obcessed with the beautiful puzzle of football, feel touched and say like: 'your body! Your body....coach!' *stern and atypically severe tone, that contrasts with her usually child like aloof innocence* 'O MEU CORPO PODE COMER MERDA!' Then... she basically starts playing, feels incredibly innadequate and overwhelmed by physicality, and quickly gives up, ending whaling in tears and depressed for a couple weeks. She starts hating the other team, against whom they were already losing, and desires revenge
