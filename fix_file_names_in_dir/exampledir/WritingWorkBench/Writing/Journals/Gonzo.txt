Gonzos musings:

Tweaking out... like what does 'tweaking out' even mean? First of all... I dont like people who say it because I have friends and had a girlfriend who were severely mentally ill and the experience is not fun. Second, when did we start inventing these idiotic, attention grabbing catchfrases? We invented 'gays' for same sex dating men, 'lesbians' for same sex dating women. 'Whinners' for emotionally distressed people. And nowdays everyone feels like a professional at detecting PDs with no training, discussion or even a bit of the elusive common sense... 'Sociopath' this, 'Narcissist' that, 'Lunatic' (which was previously known as a clinical term for ADD people who lacked in the same (or even any) mental zest of the hyperactives, this according to a professor of Maria, who is enrolled in Pharmacology in Porto, Portugal.) Like... do not even the minds that are broken get to catch a break?
