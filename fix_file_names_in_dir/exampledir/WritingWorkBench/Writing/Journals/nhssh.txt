Today, I woke up feeling pretty good about myself. I had a dream where I had bought a beyblade (A a galaxy pegasus) and was just letting it rip!!!!!!!! Then... still half asleep I suddently remembered: "I have absolutely no food. I need that to take my medicine! No! No! Im gonna have to walk for 30 minutes to lidl and then another 30 minutes back without my 54 mg of concerta!!!!! Noooo!!!! THIS WAS SUPOSED TO BE A MADNESS FREE, CLEAR THINKING DAY!!!! MY FIRST ONE IN LIKE A WEEK!!!!! WHY MEEEE???!!! I know I can focus better as soon as I take it but the effect will be WAY WORSE!!!! IM GONNA ACT LIKE AN IDIOT DURING THE WHOLE DAY!!!!!! GRRRRRR!!!!!! So then I just wallowed in my misery for like 30 minutes while rotting in bed and muttering: "The day is gonna suck the day is gonna suck the day is gonna suck I dont wanna get up I dont wanna get up I dont wanna get up I dont wanna get up it will be like 1 hour and a half while starving, unfocused, sleepy and hopeless!!!! WHY????!!!!! THE MORNING IS THE BEST TIME OF THE DAY!!!!!!! SCREW ME!!!!" But then, a song, a maidcore song, one of my favourites, popped up in my head: Artificial Stupidity by Yakui the Maid. It mixed break core with rock and metal. It relaxed on the breakcore parts and then hits like a truck on the often multiple minute long riffs. I love it. Feels like 90s football... chaotic, fun, raw. I then muttered: "Just put that on and feed off your anger. Drown the hopelessness! Rebel against your unwanted futures!" I then got dressed, put on the music and left. When I arrived at the big, empty, straight street that would lead me directly to lidl, The big riff kicked in. I felt possessed! I got a run up and started hopping and running with all my force! The riff just kept going and my anger would not stop! I just kept jumping and running with full force! Then the riff stopped. I was already absolutely starving, so when the song stopped, I felt SOOOOOOOO DIZZY! Then I walked the rest of the way there. I was then inside lidl. I picked my pizza from the shelves and also the soup and went directly to the automated card payment thingies. I just felt so much unreasonable hatred and anger! Then I realized one of my soups was leaking. My god I was gonna f*ing explode! I then left the payment area after already having paid for my 3 pizzas (Very healthy and nutritionally varied diet, I know) while dragging the bag which already had two soups in it. I walked straight at the pre cooked food area with no regards! A woman minding her own business accidentally got in my way and just kept walking without even looking at her! She got out of the way, of course (as she should). I then put the bad one back, took a good one and went back. Then, during some instant while I was paying I got an intrusive thought that said (In my native language): "Baixa a bola, rapazeco! Os teus problemas não podem ser assim tão sérios, ok?" I yelled: "CALM DOWN MY ASS!!! I WOKE UP AN HOUR AGO AND MY DAY IS ALREADY SHIT!!!!!!!!" Then a Lidl employee came up to me and asserted himself saying this: "Hey! tone down! There are children here!" Because Im such a pathetic coward loser shitnerd, I did not know how to reply right away. But I had to come up with something. So I then yelled: "B.
B...B...B- But T- They are gonna learn them eventually! Wh- Whats the difference?!" After I was done with paying, I yelled: "They are children!!!! They dont give a crap about words!!! They dont possess adult stupidity yet!!!!!" And then left. In retrospective, I wish I had been more assertive. I wish I had not stuttered!!!! I did not deserve to stutter!!!! I was right! I was right! I dont complain! I am a real person and my problems are also real ok? Stuttering was not just humilliating. It was outrageous! I failed myself! I should have been more intimidating!!!! I should have been more powerful! My rage was the right type! It was not suposed to fail! It was directed and punchy! Not vague and repressed! Grrrr! He should have been intimidated! He should have started crying too!!!! WHY DO I ALLWAYS FAULTER WHEN PEOPLE CONFRONT ME EVEN WHEN I AM RIGHT?!!!!!! ITS NOT FAIR!!!! THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS IN KINDERGARDEN, PRIMARY SCHOOL, MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGG SCHOOL!!!! WHY?????!!!!!! MY PROBLEMS ARE REAL!!!! I AM REAL!!!!! BELIEVE IT, DAMMIT!!!!! I AM NOT SPOILED AND WEAK! I AM STRONG AND MY EMOTIONS DESERVE RESPECT! I DESERVE RESPECT!!!!!!! WHY DO OTHER PEOPLE GET THEIR EMOTIONS AUTOMATICALLY ACCEPTED AND I DONT?! WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE BE CONFUSED, CLUELESS CLOWNS AND I CANT?! THAT IS IT! FUCK THIS CLARITY AND CRITICAL THINKING BULL CRAP! WE JUST HATE NOW! FUCK MATURITY! I FEEL LIKE I AM THE ONE WHO TRIES THE HARDEST AND FAILS THE MOST AT IT ANYWAY! AND PEOPLE DONT EVEN SEE IT!!!! Whats the point... Im gonna talk about my crush Neenee now: She is an entitled, sored-ego possessing, absolute f*ing wetblanket, morality high horse riding, bullying chump! Her personality is bottom tier garbage, her attitude makes me wanna vommit and no one cares about her unshaved armpits! Its not a big deal ok? And you already shave your legs! If the people that actually care wanna talk, thats the first thing they look at! I barely notice peoples noses or ears or eye brows! Let alone their armpits! You are not that much of a contrarian, ok? You are not that girl. Please, sometimes you should reaaaaally sit down. And no one cares if you are trans or not! No one disregards them in meetings! They just are not fucking assertive enough because, although they might have genuine reasons to change their bodies, It still hammers their self esteems that were ALREAAADY WAAAAAY DOWN LOW! You are not the main character, ok? So please just shut up. And then, Any time I wanna share some emotion with you, connect with you, you know, normal human being stuff,  you just start being like: "Ok and? Whats your conclusion? What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate? Why do those things matter?" Bitch WHAAAAT???! You know what? I can do that too, you know? I can act like that too! But NOT WHEN I AM ALREADY STRUGGLING TO BE CLEAR! Why do you do that?! Why?! You dont talk to other people like that you absolutely pathetic irl internet troll!!!! Come at me like that when I can actually think propely, ok? If you are gonna tease someone, try to at least be entertaining!!!!! Today, I dont wanna leave my damn room! Im just gonna sit in my bed, rot, hate on everybody (with nuance and intellectual maturity, of course... God forbid men not be 100% perfectly articulate every damn second in their lives!!!!!!) and watch beyblade videos. God forbid men do ANYTHING! But then I remembered. Yakui the Maid is an internet created character that has the gimmick of being addicted to, very knowledgable about and obcessed with medications and drugs.. and also chases people on the street to give them advice about medications. The song that kept popping up was Artificial Stupidity. So, Yakui the maid, the protagonist and avatar of these songs, is a drug addict. What are pills and drugs? Artifical? What does Yakui do? She gets high on them and goes....stupid! Artificial...  Stupidity! Artificial Stupidity! Thats it! Thats all that it means! And I was here giving these songs all these convoluted and excessively complex meanings... like their a metaphor for the elusiveness and everlasting presence of suffering amd stuff... And that its the "perfect genre for dealing with emotions" Or whatever... When I realised this, All the anger just went away. Man... I am just so incredibly and unbearably sweaty person... Thats all you need in your day, sometimes... a long and deserved break just for silly fun... Just realising that things are simply not that serious or urgent... all these artists want to and like to do is have fun making songs that hit hard and have silly titles... Maybe thats what other people saw in me when calling me a loud and overly dramatic bored loner... I think I get what they mean now
