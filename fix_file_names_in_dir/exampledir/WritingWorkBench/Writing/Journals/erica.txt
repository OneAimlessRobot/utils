
A song by madoi the maid. The bewildered maid from the song: "Dream summoner pill".

A song about... confusion, overwhelming exaustion mixed with... despair. Existential dread fills up your insides as your whole body aches and your torax pants painfully. The wars you fought, the wounds that still dig and sting into your body and mind fully present, the scars that will always stay, the stiches life gave you so you dont completly come undone with a mild gust of wind. As you roam the earth in search of meaning, the people you meet give you indifferent looks, disgusted glares, shocked glances. Their faces are mixed with fear and confusion. Just as much as you are afraid and confused at them. Their minds cant understand, neither cant you. They understand your glaring weaknesses. You understand theirs. Two puzzle pieces perfectly symmetrical, that will never fit together. You... and the rest of the earth. The streets, smelling of rotten fish and humid grass, fill up your senses. The voice of laughter and steps around you, as you hug yourself in the cold unforgiving night, looking for your way home, as nobody around you even considers looking at you. Stumbling, gripping your sides and breathing unnevenly, You consider sleeping on the street for the night and calling it... an existence well lived, but you dont give up. You keep going. Bleeding from both your wounds and from the weapons you carry, people chase after you wondering about the best way to contain you, like so many before them that have already failed. You remain detached, confident, vulnerable, needy... You then glare at them, with murder written all over your body, and curl your index finger at them... and ask: "Want some more?" And smirk at them, ready for one more challenge.



My vibe...: "Erica goes home to his parents. She is 12 years old in middle school and is in 6th grade. Its 1 pm, its sunny, its been a week since school started. The air got much fresher since the beginning of this year. Youre Erica. You have lunch with your parents and ignore all their questions about your day. You rush your homework after promissing you worked hard on it. You go play with your mates. But its already 4pm, and at this time, one comes to your neighbourhoods public playground. You grab your dirty, somewhat worn down soccerball and head sprinting euphorically to one of the walls you usually kick it against. You stand there... still panting. Then you start. With a relaxed body, sensations of fun, the ball bouncing on your bodly tissues, the hardness of your skull, the softness of your belly... the ball caresses you. No matter how hard you kick it, it comes back. It always comes back. You can scream at it and shout and cry... beg... pray. Its yours. With an engaged expression, your keepie ups get consistent. As you kick up, hook it over your head to the other foot, kick it up 2 times, wrap your leg around, catch it with the second. Then, as your mind decides to wander, you keep it on your knee. Your attire? A spanish kit from 2012, from your home fatherland, given from your cousins. The blue ocean, wide shorts, A red blood shirt, the castille emblem sewed into your heart. A bastion of war and passion. Now... a sleep and playing. As a smile forms on your face and the air starts to get fresher, you realize, unbothered: "20 more minutes before home". You kick it up again, roll it over behind your head on your neck, a casual, conventional body language. Frail, like how when  you grew up. But then... You hear the old familar distant Pot Banging "Erica! Come back, my dear! The cartoons are playing, sugar! The rice is ready too!" So then... you pack it up, you leave. The raging, hispanic bull will now feast on the grass.. of family affection, from a childhood... that could have been. You now look at reality, this stranger who just found you, insulted you, and you decided to arouse... to completion, the 3 PDs and... the huge void that never got smaller like you hoped. Here, on this dirtt alleyway, your eyes open up once again after another hopeless daydream. Your senses rattle you up like a tazer, making you reel, realize and then... conform


Hello! I am Erica. I hail from Cascais in portugal. At least... thats were my rotting newborn to-be corpse at back in 2000... I am 172cm, 65kg, 24 of age (F). I am very beautiful, I am ultra smart, charming and I have a surface boundary for a soul. I like painting, my engraved knife, my Boss Beatriz. I am a most wanted arsonist and love explosions. The ones inside the bedroom are not bad either. My birth day is celebrated world wide! I am smart and beautiful! I also have no purpose. 100% BPD result.

"Awww... someone is looking shyllly at me, isnt it? *says this curling her finger and staring into your eyes with a desperate smile* Come closer."


Ok so... Today... Its me Erica... Mommy Erica, talking to the world why she is the way she is: I go see therapists frequently, and I get screened alot for different kinds of diagnoses. Currently, I have 3 very strong and very easly explainable ones and its those Im gonna share: 
I have NPD, BPD and HPD. First, I have NPD. Because, I grew up begging and getting virtually nothing, to resorting to acting tough and stealing, hurting and even... murder, always using my past as an excuse, in order to get by. Then, when certain people started catching me in action, they approached me, promissing confort and food, in exchange of... 'special errands'. And that kept going pretty much until this day. Being constantly discarded when out of utility, taken in when displaying potential and jumping from gang, to criminal group, to criminal that... So, my sense of worth is TOTALLY on the outside. Totally. Then, I have BPD. Because, during my interactions, I, obviously, got needy sometimes. When it happened, I immediatly thre tantrums. Stronger, and stronger, and stronger until they finally gave me what I wanted. But I never developed an identity and only learned how to 'get things' just because they looked pretty or tasted good or were loud or because I wanted them. I basically cannot adult or think about my future on my own. I need other people to do it for me. So I had to learn how to exploit, understand and match peoples vibes. My emotions were always a mirror from other peoples, always extreme and I am very manipulative and exausting to be around. Third: I have HPD. Because, people tend to be attracted to the pretty. Plus, Im very artistic and like expressing myself, albeit in twisted, chaotic and dangerous ways. I always looked pretty because of my unique green, emerald eyes and ruby hair. So then, I developed a diamond heart. Also, I enjoy seducing people to get them to have deep conversations with me, but they always leave then they 'bust'... so I never see them again, cementing the belief that I must 'just be prettier and seduce better', making the cycle run. Damn... it took me 24 years to figure this out... Oh! and I get 100% score in bpd tests very consistently. My average NPD score is 86% and my HPD score is on average 92%
