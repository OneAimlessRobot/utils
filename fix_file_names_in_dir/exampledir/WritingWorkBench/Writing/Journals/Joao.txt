Joao diary

I will die bored or I will die full. Life is such a roulette that you will never guess. Flutuating things like meninglessness and fullness are untamable. Each time my destiny changes, give me a coin. With that sheer ammount of brass, I will coat the world.
Each time I despair, for each pat on my back, the sheer ammount will take me to space.
