time to do silly things. found out about the silly boy and girl clubs on reddit. they are very .... I wanna say emo but that simply does not capture its essence. I am very clingy and I am starting to develop a habit of doom scrolling. i must keep going. rap rap rap rap rap niiinja.( isto é o quê?)radio stalking. Its The shitnerdy obcession over remote invasions of privacy remotly through thoughts. Every loser can relate. I am so exausted. (isto é o quê? isto é rap ninja, isto é  rap rap rap rap rap ninja) done stacks in x86 processor simulator (É cowabunga) but cannot apreciate it yet. (need to implement register windows. It should be easy, right?) (trouxe a minha gente, a minha banda. Solo de guitarra memo em corda bamba). polyneuropathy. I have an ED which stands for Eepy disorder. The radiotrespassing rituals of having a conversation. mumbling thoughts to my girlfriend: "Youre mine and you cant leave. "....." .... OH you heard that? Its nothing... I was talking about minecraft! It was all in minecraft! smile for me if you dont want problems, ok? "...." RIGHT NOW ;)" I wish one of these airplanes would crash right into my bedroom these days... I feel more and more separated from grace day by day. why cant I have friends? girlfriend? All of them ! enough to even have spares in case one breaks! Ill promisse to be responsible ok? I wont break them in half and make them scram their insides everywhere like a tube of toothpaste I stepped on. ok? Im so tired of logic! critical thinking my ass! it wont ever fill the black hole that is now my soul. I feel so grey. My soul is filled with ambiguity and distrust. I experienced every possible emotion in the space of two hours. I should have told my doctor I needed more pills. Now... three setences in, i miss feeling nuance. why did I ever think it was gonna be fun to not have pills? whats beyond clarity of thought? Primal instinct? come on... just a small airliner. if you are gonna wake me up at 4 am at least clean the trash!
