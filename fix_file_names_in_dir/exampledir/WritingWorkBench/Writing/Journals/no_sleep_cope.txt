Me when Its my second sleepless night in 3 days: You know? This sleeping thing is not for me, ok? Ive decided. Ive tried it several ways, several times and the conclusion is the same. Other people may like it, its their lives after all... but being awake is more my style, ya know? why should I try so hard by sleeping everyday if its not for me? Other people are more made to do it, ya know? But sleeping is not my style. By the way, Did you know that after 7 in 7 you will get insta killed?
