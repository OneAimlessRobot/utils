Beatriz diary. I walk with this in my hand so the therapists do not nag me while I think.


Beatriz, Erica's boss, dialogues:

I love taking care of my assets! Making sure they keep producing and improving is my top priority. That is... if they dont cry too loud. If they do, they are disposed of.
One of them... my precious Erica...
You chuck her in a dark, cold room with a blanket, a vibrator and some cookies and the crying will be less loud! I love my precious Erica... so maleable and docile... to me that is...
Erica: *sobs and sniffs* "..... what?"
ohh youre crying again! Go back to bed! play with the vibrator! shoo! shoo! *Erica leaves crying faintly* Ahh... what a good girl...


Ok so here is another day. I decided to take Erica to the mall. She is basically a human sized golden retriever... the b**** version, and the most luxurious place of commerce she ever experienced was... the portuguese 'feiras'. She used to buy all sorts of junk from those places. And used to spend as much as she wanted. One time, she even tongue kissed me in public the dirty wh***... Anyways this is how it went:
*I walk along the portuguese factory outpost's corridors, looking through every subject's rooms, it was night time. some where sleeping, some were crying, some were acting like real men... some were doing some personal stuff they like to do... I dont judge. One of the latter, was T-799: Erica. She was in her room, laying down in the cold, concrete floor, with no illumination whatsoever, a walkie talkie for bathroom emergencies, some tissues, protein chocolate cookies and, her personal favourite: A vi***tor. She usually cries alot... but then I tell her: "sweetheart. Its ok. just grab that thing, press the small pink button and rub the round part on your cr***. it will all be ok, ok? She does it and then shuts up. She also calls me sometimes because she wants to paint. or do math... that girl has a strange hobby distribution... anyways... I come quietly and open the big, metal door. As line shines through her cage and over her naked back, I see her. she is hunched over laying on her side, with tears on her eyes and sobbing quietly, turned away from the door with her arms and legs spread out. There is a huge 'moscardo' trying to lay eggs on her ears as she constantly swats it away. The vibrator is directly in her light of sight but she does not touch it. I may have to give her something different... Like a rubix cube... UUGHHHH but then I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT DUMB HOE HOW IT WORKS!!!!! *sigh....* I speak:*
Beatriz: Hello sweet heart! A girl like you does not need to be sad... you have everything! Dont be sad... come on! Youre pretty, and pretty smart! Violent... violently chaotic and cute! Cute and... sensual. Wanna go to the mall with me?
Erica: *whispering from weakness* "Whats a.... mall?*
Beatriz: "Its a place where you can buy everything on the planet. Its where everyone in the entire world gathers to buy and sell shiny things. There is food tastier than anywhere else, technology and... cute clothes!
Erica: *scratching her bottom* What is a... technology?
beatriz: Youll see... wanna come?
Erica: *blushes* *omg... boss wants me to go? omg... Im soo tired...* boss... Im tired... I feel Im about to pass out... and my face hurts from crying... and the vibrator is broken... it does not give me good feelings anymore...
Beatriz: Thats perfectly normal! You havent had your ration yet... your body is physically incapable of producing hormones right now... So... *grabs something from her back pocket and throws it at Ericas back* Take this. its a chocolate bar. You say you love those. Eat up and come. Ill be waiting right here. *Erica eats the chocolate bar, slowly. With slow nibs and sucking, tiny bite after tiny bite. After half an hour, she is more or less fine, she gets up and asks in a normal tone:* Can... I was my teeth? Ever since you let me do it, my teeth stopped hurting.... can I do it?
beatriz: *Groans* FINE! Dont take too long! *I really hope this works*
*Erica takes 10 minutes to brush her teeth... to make sure they dont hurt ever again*
Beatriz: *resigned* ready?
Erica: "yes... can I have an Ora-"
Beatriz: "NO!"
*Erica flinches and hugs herself in terror*
Beatriz "Now COME!"
*Erica obeys*
*They arrive at the mall, in an Audi A4 from Beatriz's Portuguese outpost fleet*
Erica: What is that? A castle?
Beatriz: "Its the mall. We arrived"
Erica: "Its too big in my opinion... there is no way this is just for our planet! Its too inneficient no?"
Beatriz: "There are buildings like this all over the earth, Erica. Dont make a fuss about it..."
Erica: "But... why? Do people in mars also come to earth? And Titan?"
Beatriz: *Such a cute girl...* *Beatriz gets on the tips of her toes and starts whispering at Erica* beatriz: "baby girl. crouch"
*Erica crouches all the way down, like if trying to sit in the sidewalk on the side of a road*
Beatriz: "Thats good enough. Close your eyes"
*Erica slams her eyelids shut*
Erica: "Like this?"
Beatriz: "Yes. but relax." *Starts gently caressing her exposed shoulders and arms that send shivers down Ericas back. Then, blows in her ear softly, to then kiss her in the cheek with a long and winded smooch*
Erica: "Yes... Boss... you are so kind! I love boss Beatriz" *In an obedient, emotionless voice, but full of pleasure*
Beatriz: "Now get up."
*Erica takes long to respond. But gets up*
Erica: "The people we can see are not flowing into the building. Do we need to go around to go in?"
Beatriz: "yes. yes we do. You will see how big this is, by walking along it by your own two feet, exactly how you like it. As an experience."
*They enter the mall. Erica almost has a panic attack*
Erica: "OMG! THERE IS NO WAY MARS CANNOT FIT HERE! THE WHOLE GALAXY OF ANDROMEDA FITS HERE! WOW!!!!!!!! BEATRIZ! LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE! WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT? THAT LOOKS LIKE.... THAT LOOKS LIKE A PSP! IS IT A PSP BOSS?" *pants from heavy shouting*
*beatriz is still recoiling from the shout 7 seconds later*
Beatriz: "No. But do you want one?"
Erica: "Not really... I dont really want one... what does it even do?"
Beatriz: "You can play games inside of it, talk to people far, far away, browse the mystical 'internet' *beatriz then thinks: please dont ask me what that is... please dont ask me what that is...*, and there is places where we can eat.
Erica: "I think... about 222 trillion people can fit here all smushed together! Its scary... omg beatriz can we go outside? I got this thing inside of me and it wants to get out! *Starts panting rapidly and sweating. Erica is panicking*"
Beatriz: *Ohhh great...* Ok come with me lets take a break...
*They step outside. Erica, as she walks outside, the panic wears off. But then... she stops, contemplating the magical castle. She looks at the windows, some fallen cover bricks, some ledges*
Erica: "Beatriz? CAN I CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE CASTLE! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE??????"
