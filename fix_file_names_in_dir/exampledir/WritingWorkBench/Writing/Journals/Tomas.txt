Tomas diary.


The diary of Tomas.


ok. sooo... i came (pause, he he he...) anyway... from this like... walk and stuff... ok what was I say- ah I just kinda started walking slower and slower... and slower... and its like the world didnt even care anymore, so I kept that pace and saw like... stuff... like... did you know that people walk REALLY fast. like... REALLY REALLY fast. And then... where was I? Oh! Ok whatever. Did you know that what you do outside like... matters? If youre not ill, you can actually control how fast you think based on how you walk... thats cool. I looked at a girl and... normally im like super embarrased and stuff... but... It felt like a bubble climbing, not like a direct connection. It felt... futile to be embarrased. Not like I think social anxiety is not a problem but... idk... what if... people walked slower? I read something once... and how fast you think actually determines how content (no p) you feel, where slower is better. Like... It feels like streets are actually modeled for people to walk slowly... I actually did not put on music. When I reached for my phone, it was the same with the girl. It felt like a chore. Not like.... a scary chore, though... but like... meh... why care... you know? I may be exagerating, but... idk... makes me wonder... why even do... stuff... why not stand still, until you freeze... and time... stops? and you just sit there like... idk... for a long, long time... idk... 


It feels like life slowing down is scary. I see the image of a footballer which shall be called t. t came from training. An hour later, after a shower, eating and dressing up, he is in pijamas now. Its nightime. jet airliners roam the skies. T is in slippers... pijamas... he is walking slowly and yawning. He is a youth player. He is in a residency. He goes downstairs to talk to his mates. He stays there bantering and laughting for like 30 minutes. Then... decides to leave. Then t brushes his teeth. Then goes to bed. This image frightens me. I dont know why... so are footballers not... super human after all? ..................



If you think about it more, though... it becomes fascinating. Life stops seeming like a strenous moutain we have to climb for no reason. It starts feeling like an ocean that conforms to the shape of the ground, that harbours life, way more than the earth. It feels open, like a smile, like a hug, like a hand that caresses you, as you embrace a new kind of happiness



Like... why do we complain about ourselves for? And asking this question is now about some lazyness, or my conformity. Its the turning point people look for when waking up everyday. Its when you start living. Hedonism is not immoral. Its not irrational. Its not a waste of time. Its just... futile. just desperation for something...that delays the inevitability of silence. its... boring.............boring...... and... pointless. 



I am not stuck in hopelessness. Every movement I have acess too requires little energy, but still some. I feel floating. Like driving a car tuned for confort. For a long, long road trip along a road surrounded by trees, paved smoothly. It has no painted lines. It only has one way. Theres protecting railings. The branches as I drive, almost hit me but... they come in so slowly. The leaves have runny noses and wear blankets. The winds blow on them and make them make rattling sounds that surround me. They tell me: "Hello....goodbye. Hello, goodbye. Hello, goodbye. Hello, goodbye. Hello...". The deep forest road irradiated by the silvery light of the morning sun. Thats what my soul looks like.


My soul feels like... optimistic futility. Its not even... the result of purpose. Its beyond the need for a purpose. Something philosophers never pondered can actually be real. Looking for purpose is hedonistic. Its not "Dont do that!". Its not "Please dont do that!" . Its not "Please, consider not doing that." Its not "Please, dont." Its not "Dont." Its not "Why?" Its..." Why.".


As I tackle lifes unavoidable challenges, I dream not of what is beyond this life, but what can be made of any state I feel. I may seem lazy, but I dont feel like being anything else. Anything else is... sigh.... just.... I feel like everything and nothing. I know it all and I know nothing. I am angry and I am at peace. I just wish... everyone could see what I see... sometimes... I feel rebellious. But then I think, I never needed to rebel. So then I feel sad. But... I simply chose this path while others did not. So then, finaly, I stop being bothered by that. And then by everything else. Thats what has to happen for people to wake up.



I count spiritual calories, and pay attention to how my eyes shape the world that surrounds me.
