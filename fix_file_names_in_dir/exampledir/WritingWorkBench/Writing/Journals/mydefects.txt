My worst coping mechanism is, by far, excessive and very often absurdly unproductive indulgence in immagination. My second worst is performace/appearance behaviour



I am so tired of rotting! That is it! Its like every little thing is difficult! Aaaahhhhh its like I have to warm up my brain before working on anything! I have to fight a rut when waking up, I have to fight another before breakfast, one before arriving to college, one before RETURNING FROM college, one before studying, one before socializing... GRRRRR!!!!! I WANT TRUE ALONE TIME BUT LIFE JUST DOES NOT EVEN LET ME GET PAST WARMED UP! Living far from college SUCKS!!!!! I CAN SAIL through topics in lectures when its a new thing, but its soo hard to practice when I get home that keeping up after that is just IMPOSSIBLE! I need more fucking hobbies, man! It just makes me so angry! And then someone wants to talk to me because they like me when my brain isnt fucking falling appart rusting and then Im like: "uhhhh... uhhhhh....uhhhh... what do you like to do in your free time?" Like WHAAAAT????!!!!! I CANT POSSIBLY BE FOR REAL, CAN I???!!!!!!!!!!! And then people see me working on like a huge project or something (when I am not rotting and dont feel like the biggest user that ever walked the earth) and are like: "why do you work so much? take a break!" BITCH WHAAAAAAAAT???!!! WHAT ABOUT YOU TAKE A BREAK?! I MEAN... WHY DONT YOOOOOUUU TAKE A BREAK?! HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET OUT OF RUT AFTER RUT AFTER RUT AFTER RUT! YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS TIRED!!!!!!! Sigh.... at least its clear now.
