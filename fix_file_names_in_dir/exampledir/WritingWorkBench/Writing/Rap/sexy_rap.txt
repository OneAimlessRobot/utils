Sexy rap verses:

*rapping* Deep breaths as I hold back the plasure. Trying my hardest not to submit to her pressure

The more you push the more I reel. The more you touch the more I feel. None of these emotions feel real. Getting hot! Burning in a grill

Stressing like crazy when she whispers in my ear! My minds at war trying to hold back fear! Her seductive leers piercing, I let out salty tears!

Blushing, shivering, shaking, squirming! Getting too flustered from being her play thing!


Being her fat, useless puppy, sweating like hell! The same scorching hell it feels like when under her spell!

I flinch when you get close. Tethering on the edge. Beautyful and sharp like a deep red rose!

Like your lips! Catchy like your hips! I swear if you keep behaving like that Ill have to be put in jail! Far away from as possible, keeping myself from admiting I cant help when you make me fail!
