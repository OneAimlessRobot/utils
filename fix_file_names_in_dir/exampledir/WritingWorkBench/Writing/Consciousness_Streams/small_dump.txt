Bro I found out I wanna make music as a hobby but besides taking great music for granted for all my life I am poor and cannot even buy the instruments required (I wanna make something similar to maidcore artists) (electric guitars are expensive)! I know I could just snatch some samples but someone has to play them! I already found my special place and can dig deep when practicing my hobbies and all that crap but I only have 2 consistent ones with the alternatives being bantering with the two people who actually care about me (I lie. Im too lazy to call my family. Nvm they will just ask me what my future and meals are and stuff... You know what? Sometimes its hard to be honest about that stuff but conversations have to have some kind of starting point u not just gonna start a conversation by sharing your views on life and shit are you? (Small talk has a purpose. Im just lazy, insecure and "too cool' for it), responsibility stuff and shit talking strangers on the internet. I hated teasing when I was at primary school but Im just that twisted my guy! (I also tease people in real life SCIENTIFICALLY and CONSCIOUSLY to hurt them). Anyway can some one motivate me please?
