If I have bad thoughts, I dont deserve anything. And its not a metaphorical conclusion from a determinist. Its not anything abstract or logical or anything like that. If I have bad thoughts, I deserve no love, no compassion, no compliments and no reaasueance. If I have good thoughts, thats simply what Im expected to do
