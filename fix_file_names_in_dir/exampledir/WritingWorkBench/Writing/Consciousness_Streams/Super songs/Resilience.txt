Vibe: *Deep breath*... *Deep breath*... *Deep breath*. So... today, I got to experience what true, unfiltered anger aimed at an object with creative intent feels like. The drive that keeps you standing through the hailmarries of our daily storms. The vision... the personal vision one holds so dear and tightly on to. That words cannot, constrain or define. Innarticulable. Uncertain. Unquantifiable. Unpicturable. Cloudy. So... it all starts with a small rotation of a souped up rc engine, turning and igniting an ember, a small campfire in my soul charging lit. The machinery slowly and begrugingly beginning to unrust and crank into motion with screeching and noise. Slowly crawling... step by step... in motion. Imagining... the sensations propelling me to move. Forward. Forward. The hormones telling my muscles to explode... RIGHT NOW! Contemplating the unrellenting sense of purpose capable of pulling me across the mountains of struggle like a winch of a truck. So... misunderstood, lonely, stranded, hungry and thirsty for the change only I can envision, I push forward, chronically consistent, forever unshakable. I accelerate. I drive through the sand, the mud, the turbulent, stormy, nebulous skies, Chasing a frozen star ive been craving for the entirety of my existence. This frozen star weak and frail. Shy and a deep red. But... as I push forward and speed up, my movements faster, unveerable. My body shelling up and bracing for each possible and warmly welcome brutal impact, flowing onward! My teeth gritted and my soul sparked up and crushing itself to produce combustion! The star... pulsing... faintly glowing... hotter amd hotter! Red... orange... yellow... blue... white... Whiter and whiter! Stronger and stronger! I shall go blind just from looking at it! The celestial object flaring up in anger... smiling at me maliciously... in revolt... *fuel me.... HAHAHAHAHHA!!!! FUUUEEELLLL MEEEE!!!!!!!!! MAAKEEE ME 2 MAGNITURES HOTTER! MORRRREEEE HAHAHAHAAAA!!!!!* this anger... urging, not to destroy, but to create. To be driven and tamed for those it deems worthy... detonating as I throw the essences that my friends gave me willingly into it! The connections fuel the frozen star! Enveloped and eclipsed... by orbiting... spinning... thick, dark, dust clouds made from the elusiveness of all the noise I capture along the chase I carry on with full force! The twisted plasma sphere glowing mightly beneath all the rock and dust... unwavering and blinding hot... its energy repelling everything that dares approach... atomizing everything that dares challenge its unyielding authority! I must keep it fueld! I must! Its my soul condensed into a single point! To keep it hot I must be pure! Win! Win! Win! Forward! Ahead! Avant! Vamos! Move it! "FORWARD! FORWARD! FORWARD, I SAY!" I KEEP GOING! DESPITE THE STRUGGLE! WITH OR WITHOUT ADVERSITY I KEEP MOVING IN CHASE OF CERTAINTY! OF MORE REASONS TO KEEP GOING AND CHASING! CHASING! CHASING! CHASING! The uncertainty lighting up flares of rage across my determined gaze, fixed on the single spec in the night sky I trully crave! My purpose! My inspiration! Despite all adversity! No matter how ridiculous sounding! No matter how tame or embarassing! I ask! I attempt! I fail! I get angrier! I push more! Untold dreams flowing through my entire being like a blazing fuel! So... unbothered by any of Mankinds flaws! My manchild tendencies and my shy nature, my narcissism and my fear! My turmoil, my melancholy, I stalk and prey on my own fate! I dream! Push through social security, paperwork, exaustion and despair! I use it ALLL AS FUEL! IF IT BURNS IT SUITS! ALL THE DISGUST! ALL THE EMPATHY! All the friends they told me did not exist... the friends they told me I did not have... I wont meddle with them! I shall just push! I will perserveer! My vision approaching and ever temptingly more vivid! So I sprint! I sprint with unrellenting energy around my heart and fiery pressure around my body! I jump across higher ledges! Turn tighter and floor the gas with more and more courage! The ghost of the future I envision guiding me ever ethereal across this racetrack! So I chase it harder! By turning smoother! By dancing with the clutch and gearshifter with dexterity and full focus! Thinking faster and more thoroughly! I reason! I brake later, I accelerate, I get closer to it without burning! The frozen star uttering... Wickedly: "Keep it on the grey blur... keep it on the grey blur... avoid the brown and green blur... hahahaha.... thats it.... yes... faster... the guard rails... DONT FEAR THE GUARD RAILS YOU COWARD! USE THE WHOLE ROAD! YOU HAVE AN ENGINE! SO ALL OF IT MUST BE USED! THE ENTIRE VOLUME SHALL BE COVERED IN FIRE AND IONS! Brake hard until the discs fade! Until the calipers lock! Until the engine blows into shrapnel! Until the turbos give in from the pressure! DONT HOLD BACK! USE ALL THE GRIP THE TIRES CAN GIVE UNTIL THEY GO b o o m. Until they cant. Until you cant. If youre not scared... youre not trying. If your heart is still working... theres more to GIVE! SO GO FASTER! SMARTER! STRONGER! GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" I dare! I see the world flying by as a faster and faster pattern of blur! Because I shall only sleep when I lay on the bottom of a coffin! Until I make all the friends! All my friends! All my rivals! Heck! Even all my enemies! Acquaintances! They will all see! They must see! As they fueled me solely for this pathological fixation of mine! They better see it! Thats whats expected! I must protect their dreams, hopes and essences! All stored and detonating within you, my almighty frozen star! My always elusive guiding stellar object! Your solar flares reaching ever farther! Deterring anyone who better not try to mess with my essense! The essence of all the things Ive gathered! The dense, charged, plasma gases that keep burning and fusing! In a single ball of blinding light seen millions of miles away! The full power of my empathy, my intentional, purest, most sincere rage AND EVERY SINGLE BIT OF MY SORROW AND REPRESSED DESPAIR! After I get battered by whatever tries to break me down, with scarrs and bruises and gaping, dripping wounds... after a flurry of the hundreds of blades and attacks I struggle to keep dodging, shielding myself with my back, I wince in pain... and cry... and them recover. So... I then... still holding on to the inner child I stubburnly insist on protecting, I look back at the enemy... With a piercing gaze... with my face blushing a deep scarlet from whaling and crying... whinning and wheezing... panting with a sore throat... my breathing grumbling with mucus and thick saliva... the bulge in my throat sore from screaming... with fury... sucking on the inch deep wounds... that says: "I wont die! I WONT DIE!"  They deserve to get something from me! Its what I owe them! Until I realise all my ambitions! Struggling ahead with more and more hope! That someday this will all put an end to hopeless continuation! I am dead in search of meaning! Me! Just a filthy, rotten piece of shit. So... remember! NEVER! *pants...* *pants...* *sniffs...* *wipes tears... and then... in a stern... intentional tone... one utters:* Never stop on your way to a dream. Wether it is... a creation. An outcome. Bare minimum adequacy. Humans are warriors. So... millions must fight. So now... inside my mess of a room... the pungent smell of decay and hopelessness... Despite all that I feel... the sighing longing... the sobbing sorrow... the flinching envy... the screeching anger... all of me caged inside this rats nest like the loser I am... looking beyond the window... barely able to picture getting all the manga off my spread out body... All the entertainment that leaves me ever more empty and bitter... Me... a financial calamity... all my old friends no longer, my family... disappointed... with seemingly mo way out... my appetite non existant. Caged inside a room with the smell of smoke of my burning memories taking on breathtaking porportions... yet... still uttering: "I will get out. I will... one day. I will."

The pure struggle one may have to maintain just to... simply exist... can be trully inspiring. That just... raw... will to exist. Thats what you embody. In a world that should find in you rallying passion, it remains indifferent. Thats the crux god gave you to carry.

Just... washing teeth, showering, homework... damn.... WALKING! BREATHING! BEING!
