I look for a big street and just sprint! I sprint as the clouds go by. Me, hanging around in the plaza alone, with headphones, actively listening to what others will never understand! My words from within! My rules my dreams! Marriage? More like affectionate slavery! A job? That sounds like fun... if youre not old like my dead mama and fathah! So I watch as the sky changes from yello 2 orang 2 bloo 2 yello 2 orang! Rise n sleep early makes u a big girlie! Momma said it and she was rite! Never miss a beat! Keep up and rejoice in joy! The joy.... of the present moment.
Once a day  I lay in bed after breakfast, a time whem I visualize myself heading towards hope, unrelenting and unnapolagetically... driving the worlds cog of joy with my full power... with the help of the few people that actually still care. The moment we let go, the whole world will plummet into darkness. So, I am intentional. I look at the sun... I do not avoid the dark. Because outside of dark, it can be anything that isnt dark. And I know what I want. It isnt dark. But humans are intelligent and much more than mere survival. So I just chase after what I want not holding back for a second. I dont want anything other than I want. I dont want the *not dark* set. I want the happy solution. I am not irresponsible. Im not reckless. Im just like you and him and her and everyone. Blue pill? Red pill? Black pill? Bro? Want pills? Go to a real doctor! Because I choose happiness. Real happiness. Because I am, at the end of the day, free.
