I run along a mysterious world, full of single color, opaque shapes, scattered puzzle pieces and obstacles. All is afloat with me jumping from object to object trying desperately to reach  it. Im almost there! One more step, one more turn of the neck, one more bit of data. I suddently come across a ledge and I jump! As I look around me the world slows down, My blood Is flowing in anger to every fiber in my being, coarsing through my sore muscles, my overworked brain and my dry mouth. My lungs fill up and connect with the air
at mechanically precise intervals, my organs feed me with nutrients and other things, my legs smash everything I land on with force. I must run faster! My brain will keep up! I will absorb everything to solve this eternally elusive and incomplete enigma! As I think harder and reach new conclusions and new heights, my goals change shape. I get more and more angry and speed up gradually until I reach max velocity. A stream of pieces assembles inside my brain as I sweep across this lonely world with full force. "Burn away! Burn away all the useless, Teach yourself and learn! Grow your eyes! Hundreds of voices inside me talk over eachother and give me clues! Reveal me the world! And I somehow understand all of them! Listen to them! Master all your delusions and make them real! Listen to your intuition and judgement! Determine the worlds essence! Rebuilt it! Hopping from nuance to nuance everything slowly becomes clear! I must keep going, so I can reach it"
