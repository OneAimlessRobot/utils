Vibe: So... Its time for momma Ester to... talk about a heavy, heavy, heavy memory corroding and aching inside her mushy gelatine cake: So... i was... 17. My parents got me... yet another set of makeup... ANOTHER set... Another set of makeup... uggghhh... the disgust just thinking about it... just... my room... was like a makeshift storage facility for make up and chemistry books... I swear. So much fucking makeup... why so much fucking makeup... WHY SO MUCH MAKEUP WHY WHY WHY WHY W- *deep breaths*... wow... ok... I was almost... having a panic attack there... *giggles*. Ok. So I got the makeup... and compared it to the other makeup I already had... *Omg... this is all gonna be a makeup issue... They are gonna hate me... everyone is gonna...* and decided that the quality was too uneven. The makeup I got from... GRRRR FINE! STEALING AND THEN LEVELING... OK?!!! Public malls... it was not as good as my parents'. So... I decided that I needed... to... delete... *giggles* delete the... *giggles* delete... the mall. So... I spent like 3 days calculating... as accurately as I could, the max ammount of calories I could store in my body at that time... so that I could actually start preparing. So this was pre preparing. Then... I got the number... and started planning how to partition it. I hated running... so I was gonna assume movement was just gonna be based on the force I exert with my legs when walking times my walking speed. I went to a threadmill at a gym... putting everyone to sleep before entering (I think some guy pissed me off too, so I also decided to meld the back half of his brain into the front, like two fluids mixing. There was no way he was surviving... *Starts picking facial skin* OH wait! Deolinda told me not to do this... Ahaha... hahaha.... ANYWAYS). Then... I walked on one threadmill, did my calculations and then left. Excellent. There is loads of energy left... I also had to climb a little ledge so I also accounted for that. The spot where I was planning to go... after my makeup slightly mismatched with my expectations, was the following: There was a mall. Also... there was a forest nearby. A road between the two. Also... a small cliff where I can see the whole mall plaza and all the cars and stuff... from above. P- Perfect... f- for a sonar. *OMG ITS IN MY BRAIN! WHY ARE THESE THINGS IN MY BRAIN! WHY IS THIS ME? WHY????!!!!!!!!* *hyperventilating* *hyperventilating* *hyperventilating* Then... it was pretty secluded... because the forest ended right before the ledge that supplies an open sight to the target area. Yes... target... area... I hope you already have a picture of where this is going. I needed... to level my makeup... I had a place where I could... gather lots of air... It was grass... and forest... so I brought repellent, extra food, the weight of which I also accounted for. I kept eating several cereal and chocolate bars along the way too... to keep energy levels at max, and also... I was gonna bring several to eat while charging the blast too. I also had to bring sneakers... not highheels like I enjoyed. I also had to bring a hoodie... no one could see me. And I also had to bring psychic suppressants... and the hoodie had to be camoed. Because... if you are looking at me... it that does not mean seeing, so the psychic guards could not try anything... specially that distance. I was gonna use the suppressants... after. So... with all the prepping done, I walked there... calories storage status... within expectations. So... I took a deep breath... and focused... charging up the gland. then... I mapped out the whole area... with a powerful sonar. Inside the mall... there were... about... 4 to 5k- ish people... I was aiming at a glass facade I was directly looking at... And raised both my arms... and started... at a slow, but increasing rate, to compress air into a sphere... that was getting denser.... denser... denser... denser... bigger... denser... denser... the smirk on my face widening as I look from the top of the cliff... that turned into an almost full faced smile... bigger... bigger... bigger... bigger... I kept eating the tons of protein bars I brought with me... then... it was ready... Oh! And I also timed it so the psychic blast would align with the sun as seen from below... the trees started getting sucked into it towards the end... people below feeling a sudden, albeing slight gust of wind. Then... it stopped... It floated above me... It felt like lifting up tens of those huge supermarket 6L bottles... Then... I unleashed it... I started moving it... towards... you guessed it... the mall. A refracting ball of air... heading towards the mall... at about a rats walking pace... but that thing... i- i- it was no rodent... it was glowing... dazzling green... so... when it got near the glass facade... SUDDENTLY. I VIOLENTLY SPREAD MY LIMBS IN A STAR SHAPE, DETONATING THE COMPRESSED AIR BALL!, The blast rumble was felt even from where I was! From about... 800m away. It was loud as a thunderbolt landing right on top of the mall, the shockwave having ripped the whole facade into a wave of slicing razors, the building left with a gaping wound, exposing its naked interior, The glass... gone. and 30 people dying immediatly from the blast itself... with others being killed after being flurried into bleeding carcasses by the wave of tens of thousands of glass shards. My face... then... became tepid once again. I felt groggy... and collapsed onto all fours... panting... from pure exaustion. After 10 minutes, I took a psychic suppressant and, before the psychic guards could pin me down... I... just walked away... everything going according to plan.

HAHA! IM ESTER GLACIER! AND IM PRETTY DAMN SILLY!!! JAJAJAJA!!!!

You ask her: "Are you ok? Have you eaten lunch?" She just says: "I ate... enough."

Bih has tears of crocodiles, smiles of chimps and laughs of hyennas

You approach her on the street shes like: "Spit it, swallow it or scram."
