Its time. Its time to declare war again on my identity. I want to deliver a killing blow, shredding any doubt into nothing. Nothing will be left on the sand after Im done. One of the billions of mes will be left standing, As I collapse in tears and pure exaustion. And look at the sky, wondering: Why do humans fight... even if its what they were designed for? "Wait! You are fine just the way you are! dont!" No. I care too much. Im in conflict. Its time I go to war again, to let them all fight. Mental warfare. One of them will stand. Ive waited on my doubts for too long now. I must know... leave! This is my battle. My adversity. My sense of identity and my pride. I must know what I know and I must see what I see. I must not conform or rest, as this all means way too much to me. People look horrified... people look weirded out. The only emotion on me is anger. The will to destroy. To rule out. To take charge and fend of my enemies. The will to fight off doubt... the will to be me. The will to feel like I work well... I was not done yet. That was all a bluff. Adriano. I declare WAR! Its me... against my consciousness... and my dark side... and my reputation there will be casualties all around... and only the real me will remain! HAAAAA!
