Vibe:  What... does it mean? What... does it mean... to thrive? What does it mean? Me... encaged inside this slave camp... of other peoples values... of validation... of reading emotions and paying attention to body movements. Always on my toes... always struggling for others' sakes. A dent in my soul... another prize. A dent in my soul... another praise. A dent in my soul... another day looking for cement... cement for the emptiness. Cement that fills the cracks... but does not mix or mash. Ive been looking everywhere for a solution but always came back empty handed. The people around me adulting, the people around me thinking, the people around me organizing, finding happyness with a significant other, within themselves. Happyness... looks so real... looking from the outside. It seems... so alluring. it seems... so necessary. Such an efficient solution so people can stop worrying. A way to make them stop asking so many questions about "How do you feel?" "Me? proud! All my achievments and habits are improving, im maturing... I feel proud! And Like I am growing! I am improving! Always! I am improving! I got mentors like this ultra insightful, really humanizing, really empathetic and mega insightful, ultra realistic and grounded to earth doctor that keeps me inline! Keeps me fed with the best advice! tracks my progress! Checks up on me! And I obey! I go to the gym Immediatly after he tells me! He was also the same! He was also depressed and hollow! He can save me! His vision of me will save me! I will get there and.... uhhh... I will ok... wait... I will get there... and... AH that does not matter! All I need is to improve and get better! I dont need to know what comes after!", everyone will stop trying to help me and will leave me alone forever... everyone will start hopefully ignoring me again... I will become invisible again... soo confy... invisible... here... in my corner... just mourning my bad feelings... just... musing about my future... of what will or not be of me... of projecting how my soul will be in the future... of how my understanding of the world will shift... or... not! Just... stop thinking... be confused... be confortable with lack of clarity... just... sit in this bench... in a public space... not doing anything... not resiting at all... just... bridging the subconscious and the super ego... the trade... of a lifetime. Allowing myself to be bias- NO! Thats not it! lIkE jUsT tHiNk aBoUt It! DoNT bE coNFuSeD! ReAlIzE! rEALiZe! Think clearly! Dont be biased like a stupid idiot! Everyone will laugh at your biasednessness! Everyone will think your not critically enough of an endless stream of emotional pornography that just goes around spouting so much of their soul poured... into the earth... surely this will all turn profit... someday... Just go forward and never stop and insert and integrate your shadow! Make it all conscious! make it all... soo much more... safe. and... confortable to touch. So much less... disgusting. So... orderly. All you need is reason. Adult! Face adult adversities! So then... what about... why not... ok when can I stop... improving? When I become happy... what comes after? is that the whole point? Do I just need to become strong and then life will peak? Will it all just... peak and never improve? Is it all that there is to it? Smarter? harder? Wiser? Happier? Is that it? No! I refuse! ok? I refuse to be a coward that hides the self behind a layer of control! I am David! And Ester! And Sofia! And I will not invalidate no longer! I wont bother! I was never meant to exert or control... life forms stressing about ceasing... life forms wary of no longer... knowing. We dont fear death. We fear... the unknown. So we adult, we outsource our values! Ester: "And our logic!" So now we walk as empty husks! Empty because we never went after what we want! We never figured out how to live on our own! Animals forever in captivity! Restrained by the most ethereal rules of society! Me... a Pragmatic Perserveering Prototype. Always improving... Thats the reality. The concrete truth is... to reach connection... there is no deserve... no finish line! no goal and no deadlines! Ive never changed! I never stopped feeling this! This is the emptyness that will stay until I stop waiting! Because... I am... a prototype. I tweak and tune myself up. Always looking for the best parts... and... thats okay! Its also okay to feel confused! Its always okay to seek feedback! its always ok to not know what you want! because my being is always out of balance... balance not an achievment. Its... art. Im a mechanical starfish. A machine with a beating engine, flowing fuel and gelatinous electronics. Sparking metabolism. There is no integral state to balance. It has no shape. It has no definition. Because its a process. Its dynamic equilibrium. Its an endlessly singing chrorus of beliefs... a schizophrenic cacofony of insights pushing and pulling... you casting huge nets to collect them and mash them together... to form an image... that will someday... encapsulate... who you trully are. Like tweaking an engine... I mess with fuel flow - intensity, I mess with discipline - anti roll bars, I mess with turbo boost - restraint. I tweak each and every single part of my body... and in the end... what I look like... from the outside... is a cobbled mess... which is innevitable because, in the end... balance is such a rare thing... it will always look unusual. So... after the naysayers meet me, once again, on the day of the game, after mocking me and pointing out how much of a mess I am... I turn back and look up at them in the stands... Lay on the grass of the pitch of life... and spread my limbs out... with my shirt off... all my muscles... in their current, so evident state of something in development... development that was not gonna conclude with something as trivial as a game... I want them to see... each muscle pulsing... each tweak... a lifetime of increasing efficiency... 1 percent at a time... in some areas... 2 percent less at a time... in others... each fiber having a special place in my heart... each drop of blood carrying a different facet of me... a faced I must optimize... But I must remember: I can always choose to be a P.P.P. - Perserveering, Pragmatic Prototype, a Mechanical Starfish. A sore athlete... a confused mathematician... a numb poet. Forever a raw, messy mashup of spare, polished junkyard parts. 


I shall embrace the voices of the void. The void that will never ever fill up. Fulfillment a temporary illusion. An excuse the judgemental use to label human confusion. "Are you confused? Do you doubt yourself?" You lack purpose! Im gonna tell you: There. Is. No. Purpose. There is just life. And connection. Sex. Creativity. Intimacy. And... fun.

Trans people are true warriors. Angsty teens are true warriors. Beta males. Chad males. Anything on those labels unites under a single banner: Perserveering, Pragmatic, Prototype. Some seek optimization in intimacy. Some optimize identity. Some optimize ambition. Some optimize wisdom. 

We are all prototypes. Consume the present. Face the future. Adapt. Connect. Enjoy.

Now... the voices: 
I run along a mysterious world, full of single color, opaque shapes, scattered puzzle pieces and obstacles. All is afloat with me jumping from object to object trying desperately to reach  it. Im almost there! One more step, one more turn of the neck, one more bit of data. I suddently come across a ledge and I jump! As I look around me the world slows down, My blood Is flowing in anger to every fiber in my being, coarsing through my sore muscles, my overworked brain and my dry mouth. My lungs fill up and connect with the air
at mechanically precise intervals, my organs feed me with nutrients and other things, my legs smash everything I land on with force. I must run faster! My brain will keep up! I will absorb everything to solve this eternally elusive and incomplete enigma! As I think harder and reach new conclusions and new heights, my goals change shape. I get more and more angry and speed up gradually until I reach max velocity. A stream of pieces assembles inside my brain as I sweep across this lonely world with full force. "Burn away! Burn away all the useless, Teach yourself and learn! Grow your eyes! Hundreds of voices inside me talk over eachother and give me clues! Reveal me the world! And I somehow understand all of them! Listen to them! Master all your delusions and make them real! Listen to your intuition and judgement! Determine the worlds essence! Rebuilt it! Hopping from nuance to nuance everything slowly becomes clear! I must keep going, so I can reach it"
