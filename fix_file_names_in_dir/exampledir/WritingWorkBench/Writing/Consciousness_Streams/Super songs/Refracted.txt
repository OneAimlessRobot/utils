A simple, big mountain range is showered by peace at 16pm. Blue in the sky is very scarce and the sun looks like a sword that pierces the clouds forming bolts of light. The birds are chirping out of tone and the water is agressively flowing down rapids. For some reason, I stand in place, shaken by all kinds of vortices, stirred up by a mysterious instability. I can barely think hard enough to form tears, my entire body trembles. I look terrified with a shocked, overwhelmed look and a hopeless expression on my face. I stand powerless and with convoluted blobs of gas merging in and out of my mind and my body, flipping all kinds of switches. I stand with my feet facing forward and paralel to shoulders. My fists are gritted and my breathing is rigid. All I see is thick, frosted pattern engraved glass, with light refracted through it. Suddently... the water stops in place, all the birds fly away, the skies go black, with every cloud flowing into the summit of the highest mountain. The ground starts lightly vibrating. I slightly puff my chest. And yell with all my muscles and zest: "AHHHH!!!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!! LET ME OUUUTTT!!!!! TAKE ME OUT OF THIS PLACE RIGHT THIS SECOND RIGHT AWAY  AND RIGHT NOW!!!!! " The mountain blows up with ear shattering shockwaves spreading across the valley and spewing all the water out of every nearby lake and stream. Giant rocks are spat out by the angry geological formation and fall all over the place and around me as I cry uncontrollably, on my knees. One rock of my size falls right beside me burying half of itself into the soil with a loud *thud!*. I barely budge and continue my crying. Giant clouds of toxic particles fall on my eyes and inside my system as I whale in agony and start coughing. This goes on for 3 minutes and I pass out. I stayed unconsious for days. But finally wake up in a bed inside a house of a nearby local village, sit down and mutter: Where... am... I?
