Diogo.

I am Diogo. I am currently a student in a formal academic setting. They teach us rules, principles, honour and to strive for success. It suits me. I enjoy it. My friends say that I am a block head, that I am not relativistic enough, that I half ass my life. But I wont let that go through me. I am peaceful. I am honourable. I am dependable. I am curious. And I will allways stand my ground when my very essence is questioned. I am an honest folk after all. I work to please, not the machine or anyone in particular. But my true pride. I dont care about superiority or bragging. I just please my gods. The gods of the academic world. I sing, I cry, I laugh with joy in the illustrious presence of miss victory. I am great because nothing I do is the most important thing I have ever done. I face challenges and limitations. But in a world that is so obcessed with destruction, I will carry my honourable friends on my back. In a world that tries as hard as it can to succumb to the seductive intimidation of chaos, I stand strong, in a thunderstorm, raging winds, heavy rain, the dark raging heavens cannot defeat me! With tears in my eyes and a soul full of existential dread and fear, I grit my teeth and yell: "NOTHING ABOUT THIS SCARES ME! YOU HEAR? I MAY FLINCH BUT I WONT RUN! I MAY HESITATE BUT I WONT STOP! MY COMMUNITY IS COUNTING ON ME TO BRING MORE GREATNESS TO THIS WORLD! plain little old me is standing here, stubburn and determined in the face of all of his struggles to say to everyone: dont be afraid! Dont give up! Let it all encircle you! embrace it! Because as long as you trully stand your ground, it will never destroy you! In the end, people are only great while they know their limits without arrogance"
