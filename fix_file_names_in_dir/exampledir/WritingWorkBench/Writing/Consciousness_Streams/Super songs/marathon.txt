Why I want to run a marathon

Its like its hardcoded in me. I love going fast with effort surrounded by people. Feeling myself protected from air, being able to run faster and faster and never ever reaching the front, looking around me, seeing more and more people... "all of them do it. So I do it too" pops up in my brain but... its not a terrorist. Its a soldier. Does not feel like a mean teacher. Or goofing around in class. It feels like a 9pm discord call after HW. And I feel *clonk*'d to life. Connected, assembled. I want to go to a pride parade and just run until I reach the front, turn around and do it again if they start moving. If I go running by myself, Ill get tired. Absurd right? But if someone that I trust goes with me, I m not so sure, you know? Btw I figured out that I can just say "shitpost" and people will eat it like cake! Im a genius! Anyway... my fave part of P.E. always was the warm up. Because class was running in a group. Even when in a high effort mood, I run like on EPOs during warmup. 


Because Friendship is the biggest EPO of them all
