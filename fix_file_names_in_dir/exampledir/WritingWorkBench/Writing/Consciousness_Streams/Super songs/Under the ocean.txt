Title: Under the ocean.
Genre: Soft, gentle, guitar rifs and... synth and drum and bass... soft... floaty... immersive... melancholy.
Vibe: I think... this is what a computer feels when you dont close descriptors... or free your RAM... or when you are alone... in the default, idle human state. Stasis. Here goes: I was in the zone... typing in my computer. I was in the zone... the perfect mindspace... trying to hold onto something to keep myself grounded. Floating under the ocean... the water currents nudging my limbs around soft softly. I was writing... and then... a accidental keyboard shortcut... closed my eyes. It closed the file... the memory copy buffer of my windows Operating System.
It all ended. My closed eyes... the fresh salt in my wounds... it feels... strangely... cathardic. its gentle, meaningful, peaceful catharsis. The longing, the sadness, the comfort in regret... the places ive been... Highschool... the small country side villages... the friendships... all moving on... all gone... all a part of the past that will not come back... yet... I look at all of it and imagine it in no other way. I accept it. This melancholy... this tinge of regret is my soul, my soul... breathing the heavy, pressury, comfortable, fresh water of the ocean. My body floating down, like if anchored by my nostalgic mood. My naked body... flailing around like seaweed... like anemonae. The videogames ive played... Counter Strike 1.6. The nostalgia... the videogame mods Ive created... the ones ive been inspired by. the connections ive made inside a round of counter strike... where I barely won any games... but it was so much fun... playing with other people. But then... I started playing alone... creating my own fun worlds. My own fun creations and me exchanging banter, wisdom and sarcastic remarks. But me... still floating... floating through life... peacefully... with my eyes closed... my body spread out and getting carried... waving around... a relaxed look in my eyes... neutral and calm. The ocean... that monstrous creatures inhabit... it knows me... and it wants to talk to me... I listen to it... and nod in my thoughts... agreeing. This is the ocean... of despondency... of nostalgia... of melancholy. This is the special place... where no one can find me. The blue abyss I lay in, sinking slowly and ever deeper... is the place where I find my essence... the essence of humanity itself. Each person holds the blessing of humanity... so  they can access it... at any time, float in its essence... talk, reason and feel. My heartbeat that refuses to stop... my body growing... slowly... fresher and fresher... and colder... all the shadows of my past... the academic award cerimonies I did not go to... my days sleeping until 11am, waking up to breakfast, playing videogames, and even earlier... waking up singing, starting off my day with bustling energy... eating breakfast, washing my teeth and going to my room to make drawings... to then show them... draw... and show... draw... and show... my ocean waving and flailing me gently... like a meat, water, hair flag. my skin growing more pale and green, my eyes growing redder from the salt... the huge... colossal abyss above, below and around me... the creatures hidden and waiting... patiently... for my presence among them... so we can have yet another personal conversation, like old friends. The pure blood flowing through my limbs, my meaty, organy, bony, hairy and watery body dancing to the flow of the soul... feelings... transcient... knowledge... frail like ice... depression... mankinds default state of mind. Confusion... the feast of intellectuals. Pain... the feast of athletes. Sorrow... the feast of poets. Gratitude... the feast of saints. Chaos... the feast of the damned. I see it all... its all in me... its all in you... its all inside everyone... the blood making my organs pulse and keep going... as I appreciate the placement of my organs... all packed against eachother... somehow in harmony... all the tubes of meat, and cartilage, all the intestine, mushy tubes... all the nutrients and organic paste travelling all over me... my legs giving up, my arms spread out... my body becomming heavier... the sinking getting slower... time... slowing down... my system... cooling down... more... and more... slowly... as My eyes open... 3 rays of sunlight piercing the waters, reaching them... making me smile. 

In the end, My life keeps going, because my heart never decided to stop breathing

What always made me smarter, was confusion. In a hungry search for certainty, absurdity is the main attraction.

I like contributing. I dont want praise. I want servitude. I dont want compliments. I want to be thanked.

Those people are doing the same as me... just looking at a different part of the journey... the goal. I look... at the landscape.


This... Its you. Its me. Its everyone
