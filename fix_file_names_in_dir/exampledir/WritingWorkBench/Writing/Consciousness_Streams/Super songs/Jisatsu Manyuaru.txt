Title: Intro.
Author: Yakui the Maid.
Genre: Soft, melodic, Synth metal.
Vibe: ....Intro is a song of end of day despondency... You lay in bed... not really wanting to do anything... You feel as close to falling asleep as you are close to waking up. The duality of sleep... one is always as close to slumber as they are to waking up. So then you fall sleep.... The memories of today... never imagining being in bed... "Who would have thought... that... after that whole day... I would be laying here... away from all the noise and interference? Away from all the cheers, laughs, walking, running, jumping, crying? All the places where Ive been? Just to return to this small corner of my home, such a small corner indeed... my comfy mattress... *yawns*". The pain in ones own skeleton, muscles and mind. The emotional grogginess... the thick, saliva lingering in their mouths... the existential dread after a whole day of non stop activity... "So... we just do this... until we die, huh? Where do people get their energy? Where do I get mine? Is it even possible for sleep to coexist with bustling activity like this? Life really is... confusing.". The daily experiences... so disorienting... the activity... still lingers in my meat... in my water... in my bones, eyes... my feet hurt... *yawns*... they hurt so much... so... next to a significant other or otherwise... As you finish having your intimate, together time, full of pleasure and excitement, this only adds to the load that pulls you down to the world of the absurdities that you keep down during the day. In this moment, one feels like they wont move a muscle... they wont hear nagging... thieves can invade them for all they care... the melatonin hitting like a truck... as one... slowly... closes their eyes... half dreamland, half reality... 25% dead... 30... 40... 50% the sleeping jerks kick in... preventing you from... literally falling to slumber... the jerks protecting you... from half suicide. But eventually... you enter the realm of dreams. The  Now... they fall asleep.

Title: Jisatsu Manyuaru.
Author: Yakui the Maid.
Genre: Soft, melodic, Synth metal.
 So now we come to the next part, Jisatsu Manyuaru. The manual of suicide, of sleep. A necessary suicide. Life brought us here just so we can be devoid of it for a third of our lives, a third of our lives barely moving... let alone... living. Now... we are in the realm of dreams, but one has to explain how to get here first: How does one... lose its consciousness... everyday... willingly... for a couple hours? Im gonna tell you some tips:
1- Be tired: If you are tired, congratulations. It means you actually need sleep. The endorfins from the work youve done today, the memories from the activities youve done circling around your head space and creating disorientation, dizzyness... the melatonin gently caressing your gelatinous, neurological brain. The hormones of slumber anchoring you to your bed... and... as the world slowly fades into a deep, pitch tone of grey, small lights appear in your vision, as you start experiencing all the lingering impressions and all the confusion you dont express during the day, you feel it coalesce into shapes, shapes we call dreams. The noise... the static... the small, tiny stars that flash lit... and dim... and lit... and dim and off... all around your mind, your brain, beginning to see fireflies, and panicking. Your memories coalescing into something you never knew possible... things not even drug addicts expect to see during the practice of their witch craft rituals. You are now... asleep. Completly vulnerable.
2- Be willing to die: to be willing to sleep... you should be willing to die... to lose consciousness... even if permanently... even wishing that is the case. Dont let yourself be carried by the pressure of coming off as a living being... thats too much work to expect from a person. Its a mask too thin... to challengable... a label one should not have to bear with during their living experience. Consciousness, Intellect, Nuance, Reasoning. Preconception. Pride. Prejudice. All is the same. Its the mind. That part of you that trully does not leave you alone. The annoying part of you. No... its not your co worker. No... its not your ego. No... its not insecurity. No... its not lack of individuation. What trully annoys humans... is the "gift"... of reasoning. Trully... the most overrated thing since drinking and partying. Underrated like... taking time with your grandma, at home... at 9pm... taking tea with her... talking about ones day... Overrated like profound stories, like extreme complexity, When all one needs... is sleep, temporary death... not to recharge, not to be productive... but... just because. As you let go of the prejudices that surround human nature, you trully embrace what it means to be alive... which implies... being willing to not be. When I was young... my mother used to say... after bedtime prayers: "Die... my sweet baby... die..."

Title: Loser.
Author: Yakui the Maid.
Genre: Soft, melodic, Synth metal.
Vibe: So... now that we know how to commit sl**ping (these words almost need to be censored nowdays... we dont want to let people know the truth), We embark on a journey to what our memories take shape as, in the realm of our unconscious. Our minds filled with strange, really bewlidering creatures that barely emit any sounds, yet... we understand them. The creatures mute and... wait... is that... mother? And... brother? What... what are they... saying...? Ok... so... I need to be more disciplined... Ok... I need... to take care of my grandma... and to become strong. I need to... man... up? I need to... commit to my career... I need to... I need to... I need to... I have... I have... uhhh... No job...? Ok... tell me more... I have... no actual friends... ok... what else? I play games all day, I self fornicate all day, I walk around all day. I dont know how to live, I only know how to exist, fair enough... mother and brother... So, with this knowledge in my hands, I should be wiser when I wake up, as my brain forms other connections that surprisingly, dont just involve my opinion of myself. Like... a cool drawing I could make, A cool song, a cool invention, but brother tells me: "You should learn how to think... you have to face reality". Thanks older brother... but Im confused! Ive done nothing but that during the day! why do I also need to do it during the night? "Because youre useless! Learn how to think" And then... and then... in my  bed I squirm, I wrestle, I moan faintly, I turn and turn around, and turn back in with a pained expression with sweat... from the overwhelming heat of the hell... that is the first layer of my soul, my loser identity. Its just nice that our thoughts are not reality...

Title: Dissent
Author: Yakui the Maid.
Genre: Soft, melodic, Synth metal.
Vibe: There are people in this earth that would rather not work a day in their lives if fully given the chance and time to think about it. There are other people... who think the same... but are so profoundly dishonest and afraid... with and of themselves... with and of others. Little death... as the philosophers call it, sleep... its a fundamental physiological, mental and spiritual need. Whatever framework you pick, you must stop. You must lay down exausted and embrace it, without any self judgement. People cant stand the honesty that life is zest demanding, draining and induces jadedness even on the strongest among us. Those olympic skiiers you see on TV? They do it out of passion and finance, of course... your boss... your teacher... yourself. We fundamentally need to survive and thrive. But that does not mean... we would initially do it by choice. The energy of activity, the melancholy of stasis... I feel it... you feel it... they feel it... the rawness, the honesty, people labeled as lazy struggling with the weight and earth shattering drumming of their chest nagging them... every. Single. Moment. Its me, its you, its everyone.
We are just more willing to accept reality. 
Who would not like to live in a manga? Everyone would...
The people who listen to that perspective and dismiss it as "Weakness" are projecting their own insecurities. They are perfectly aware of that angle... they just flinch and cower defensively when someone trully says it. Everyone would like to be in an anime... and some people dont even want to do anything about that thought... they find solace in embracing life as trully hard for them... as a true struggle that will only get harder as they move forward. Those people cant stand honesty... because they cover themselves with masks of "reason" and "consciousness" and "evidence" and "open mindedness". But they are cowards. If you can openly admit that, knowing what manga is, youd rather be in one and not in planet earth, you are not weak, you are real, raw... and strong. Those people make their judgement their identities , while historically, we barely had that for more than 3 seconds. They hold on to anything that allows them to evade death, to neglect living for livings sake... while fully aware that life... is fundamentally hard. Just laying in bed, on the beach, in the school corridor, in an office job. Pijamas and slippers with your arms spread out and surrounded by the world and just... sighing. Surrounded by so many people... so many people that would not care... so many people that you also dont care about... So many people who would rather just sleep all day... or even.. sleep... forever.
The purity of souls honesty... shall be the death of you... Everyday... during 7-8 hours. When I woke up during the night, and then my mother came to me, as a baby, in my crib, she grabbed me... changed my diaper... she layed me down again... and uttered: "Such a sweet, pure baby... I will change your diapper, then... go back to crying... sorry If I woke you up by the way... its not your fault... mommy just... feels. All people feel, ok?" *smooches you in the cheek, forhead, even eyelids... ears, head and all over* "...And those who feel, like you and mommy, well... they cry. Cry While watching shady romanian commercials from early in the morning, while thinking about dad... and sis. They are not with us, So they are better. Because I love you, I ask a favour: go back to death, my son." I imagine my mother, every night, talking to the character "Carminha" From "Avenida Brasil" and telling her... in a loop: "(n-1)"You seu ancestral mexe-a como um brinquedo, A sua vida presa numa corrente devastadora, deixando-a vazia: "Lento... feio... nojento... pobre...  nojento... pobre..."... Let go... and you shall be free. Ignore and you shall not frustrate. Embrace and you shall feel cuddled. Life affirmatively... not through the whims of your ancestors... but on your own terms. Life like Mourinho... Mourinho tells his players: "Sleep well... or dont... even... bother". Live like Mourinho. Sleep like him. Ignore wealth. Reach the higher luxuries... the glory... the spirit... the adversity. Because only those who are trully tired... can sleep... in true peace."

Title: July
Author: Yakui the Maid.
Genre: Soft, melodic, Synth metal.
Vibe: Then... suddently... the turmoil stops. You... fully overcame the mind. You endured and lasted and now... you are... trully asleep. There is nothing but atmosphere... the dimming lights are gone... the voices... the psychosis... the anxiety... the depression... the facts... the poetry... even... nothing... nothing is gone. Because your brain is resting... so you cannot think or conceive anything. You dont know what your passion is... what your enemies are... who wronged you yesterday, what lunch is gonna be tomorrow... nothing matters. Your fave videogames... what work is... what passion is... what pleasure is... what emotion is... what reason is... what thinking is... what words are... what food is... who you are... Nothing. Your projects... your house... you... Nothing... exists. There is no will of god, no starts, no matter, no time. All you feel... without being able to discern it... is being immersed in a beach, full of white sand, purple water... a red sun, only you... and floating cubes. Digital ruins... rustic homes... Your internal world is now... ready. So you just wonder... somehow being able to move... but not think. You recognize there are colors... and shapes... and 3 dimensions... but not... anything else. You feel a faint warmth though... confort. Confort that your brain does not register. You feel... at peace. An alien that does not know how nonsensical our bodies are... understandably assumes... you are as good as dead. You drool, you groan softly... in this huge desert with dunes, a pink sky, and... a huge mountain. You reach to it to try and climb it. As you do it, the world behind you stops mattering and so... rendering. When you reach the top... because you achieved what you wanted... there is nothing left for you to live for... on this night... on this dear night of July, youve achieved... sleep. Congratulations. There are those... that are not so lucky. "Wake up..." you hear... somewhere in your mind... "Wake up" you hear again... and next time the voice utters it once more, You snap. In a matter of 30 seconds, Your blood rushes faster... your body becomes less and less limp, you regain your sharpness... your internal world starts buzzling again. Your mother... next to you in bed... you see her... messy hair... deep, grumbling voice... Its 6am... its a school day. So... I linger in bed a bit more... as she makes breakfast. So now... its...

Title: Listlessness
Author: Yakui the Maid.
Genre: Soft, melodic, Synth metal.
Vibe: Listlessness. You are now awake... you scratch your behind through your pijamas... you stretch... with grogginess inside the neurological oatmeal paste inside your cranium... synapses shooting lasers at eachother... as the war on peace rages on once more. Its a rainy, sunny day, 6am in october. Everything outside is wet... and everything outside looks blueish... except inside your home... where everything looks grey. As your eyes slowly finish parsing the concept of color, your mother tells you: "Who is a suicidal maniac? Who is it? Hmmm... I can tell you a bed time story after today ok? I can... include the bullies... the friends... the crushes... all the mythical creatures that define your life... a story that validates your existence... my sweet and cute bag of meat." *as she, while closet stretching, with all the gentle care of parenthood all humans are owed, hugs you tightly... making some joints *clack*, kissing with a touch of lips to the forehead* you then reply to her... used to her sarcastic antics: "Me mom... its me.". You then have your breakfast, with the news on TV. Somehow, its 6am and there was already a murder at 4. Life trully is... confusing. You slowly eat your food barely feeling any flavours, sit unconfortable in your sweaty pijamas, admiring the mildly attractive middle aged woman on the screen, with the exaustingly formal voice and tidy clothing. "Wow... someone really is early", you utter. The weird feeling and the sensation of a dry mouth with sticky saliva still lingering, the melatonin still coarsing, slowling you down like a big cup of milk at 4am. The dreams still present in your mind as it tries to reconcile itself with the innevitability of it all. You then go to school... walking slowly to the stop... meeting up with familiar friends... slowly growing more energetic with each passing minute, as the street lamps and house lights all turn off one by one... and you get ready to do it all over again... "Do this for 50-70 more years huh?" You mutter internally...


Its not self defense... its not criticism... its self cuddling
