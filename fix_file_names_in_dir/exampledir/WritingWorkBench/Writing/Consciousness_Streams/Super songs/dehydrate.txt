Vibe: I played a song every time I visited. I was supposed to be validation. To confirm your biases. To make catharsis quicker... like therapy. It was Dehydrate, by Yakui the Maid. It was a synth rock hybrid thing. It was a whole  and exact 8 minutes long. The sounds... filled with slow stumbling  coord sequences, full of melancholy. melancholy that almost turn to nihilism... it felt almost empty... but not quite... dehydrate but not... dehydrate....ed. Like... a river... a river full of water that was dirty, white like the liquid they were injecting you to keep you nourished, smelly, stale, thick... worn down... warm... partially dried up... bubbly from pollution... all in a heat wave sunny day, in india. The feeling of rotting in a hospital bed, the feeling of having insects crawl at you but not bothering... letting yourself being digested by the earth, returning to where you belong... the earth... looking up at the night sky, full of stars, surrounded by a temperate forest, in Leiria, Portugal, full of tall, thin trees... we can see a path. there are cycadas, moths... they all land on you... take a sip from your tears and sweat... and leave. You lay there... letting the absurdity of existence take over... as you meld with the blue planet, like human mould
Ive listened to it... just laying in bed... no music... no clothes... no blankets in a summer heat wave afternoon... shutters and doors and windows locked... like a piece of meat contained in a wooden box... staling away through life... waiting until it completly melds with the earth
