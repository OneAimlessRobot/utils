*zzzzzzzz* *I sleep talk, whispering* Hard.... wind and voices whispering in my head... unlimited badwidth for lethargy and incoherent imagination
Despondency is the default human state. Energy is a mask. Despondency is the reality. Work is hard by default
*zzzzzzzzz* *drooling*
Myeloma... I am... a myeloma
*zzzzzzzzz*
*zzzzzzzzzz*
Flurries of daggers peel me open...
Selfish jesters make me sick
Deadly spears from thin air carve holes in the heads of my targets
My soul is silent. I listen to fireworks everynight... hoping my bedroom catches a bad stray
Deathless... yet meaningless
Jolting at the pain my eyes inflict on me... from the salt the tears rub on inner wounds yet to be healed
*sigh...* Clearly like Light on dark... the acid on my stomach reminds me of what I fail to be, every day
Wanting to be someone in life is what losing your essence looks like.
Going back in time 2 weeks at every step forward, I live detacheed. 
Groggy, despondent and conformed, My life is made of light bulbs inside a pitch dark cave.
The pork meat I am made of smelling like a snack for the vultures...
Deadly cancer in my white cells...
Anemya in my red cells...
My muscles are frail rubber bands that break on sneezes...
A yellow mixture of despair and gloomyness travels across my vessels... reminding me of nothing in particular.
In my movements, I am fado.
In my soul I am rock.
In my head I am Noise.
Bedrock ever lasting through erosion... one day at a time... is what I am.
But... theres still things for me here... So... I gotta wake... wake and... smell the ashes *I open my eyes*
I have to smell the ashes now. The dead city in delirium now has visitors... the people must trust the visitors
I am Ester Glacier. I came to say...
Hello.
