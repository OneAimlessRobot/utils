Ester instagram post.

Having fully accepted her psychic biology, Ester, at the gym, in something as conventional as a gym shower mirror selfie, she combined 3 things she before thought incompatible: Psychic powers, connection and strenght: So... at a Lisbon where NeeNee also trains at, after training, she stayed in the lockerroom waiting for at least 3 people to show up. She, silently,  planned waiting for them... each person showing up being told to wait for the remaining. After 40 minutes, she gathered 3 people: NeeNee, who happened to show up that day and 2 other girls. So... the selfie she took was this: She aimed her phone at the mirror, smiled. She focused... ate a protein bar... as she was already exausted, and started floating... some 10 cm above the tiled floor, and just enough for the camera to catch it Then... her 3 friends filed up behind her... spreading their arms forming "wings" behind Ester... whose face faced slightly downward, and... smiled. She had her belly out... showing a very small but built set of abs... This is the only post currently on her Instagram. A post exposing her... in an honest... but such beautiful way. A psychic with muscles... with friends. Psych mutation... strength... connections.
