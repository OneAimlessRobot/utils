All night partying with my Alt communist rebel friends in an anime restaurant! We drank until we ragdolled (on the internet), My carotid is way more durable than I thought! They promissed that if I kept trying and did my best and only expressed my true self I would get all then hugs and kisses that I could ever want! Anyways huhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhjjhhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjhhjhffccdssetiibhdcjdcrdhixd I like gambling where At every waking moment in existence I wait for the perfect opportunity to start fixing my life and my mind! But It never comes because anything more that breathing or sleeping feels like soooooo much work! I can barely sleep  at night so when I wake up at 10 am after going to sleep at 6 I stay and rot in bed until my mind just feels like sleeping again so I can feel healthy again. bbrbrbrbebrbbrbrbrbrbrnrbrnbrbrbrnbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrnrbbrbrbehshaisksnzmzmaoahqgsnslaubsmsphajjsbsonalbxkaobspoqyshxblapnamzpagbzmzpahdnzmzlapgsj Huhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhjhhhhhhjhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk. Ok anyways I enjoy talking to myself out loud at 4am so I can desperately cope with the pungent lonelyness and stress I feel while feeling like a pest because my residence room neighbhour is trying to wake up early the next (this) day and actually trying period while im just a stupid little useless worthless pest! jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajjjajajjjajjjajjjajjjajjjajjjajjjajjajjajjjajjjajjjajjjajjajjajjjajjjajjjajjjajjajjaj
