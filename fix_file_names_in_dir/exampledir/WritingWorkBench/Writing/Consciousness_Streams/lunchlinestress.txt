Lunch line stress is a disease that does not discriminate. Its a magical state where suddently being surrounded by people feels like absolute lonelyness, your past mistakes a serious matter to anyone. It feels like radiostalking, a  eerie state where your consciousnesses get zipped and sent from anyone to anyone -aura and it feels like being watched and judged. You get forced into a social mask while vulnerable. Suddently, entitlement does not feel so rude anymore. Those who know how mad it makes them are the only ones that survive, while the remainder keeps cussing and roasting and projecting acidic words to random targets. Its unnavoidable and its hell. Unless you are connected during the experience, you will come out a worse individual by the end of it.
