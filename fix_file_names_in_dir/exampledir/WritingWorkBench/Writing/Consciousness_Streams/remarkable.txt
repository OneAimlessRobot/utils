They say: "Oh man... life is not remarkable (swiftly swinging from exciting to terrifying) anymore

first response: "You are normal as is everyone else!"


second response:"
Oh man.... there were so many more useful things I could have said... like... Its a sign you realize now that life is not as overwhelming/remarkable as it used to be in your teenage years. Your perception is starting to become more tepid instead of hot or cold instinctively. for example: Before... I allways used to tell myself how everything was so hard and imagine myself fully bruised and battered. But I realized: Life... is not so bad. Or so good. its just normal. People are not so remarkable. They are standard, or weird, or cringe or, at the very end, evil. You are obviously gonna admire more people and events, no matter how small they may seem for others though. Try to remember them, so you can use it to lighten up more every day, as your experience gradually makes you more accepting and seasoned, although not as easly impressed. Use your immagination recurrently, or you will become cynical,though"
