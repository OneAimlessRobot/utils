I just feel so overwhelmed... Its like everything I do is important and sometimes even just a short insight requires me to BOOT UP my pc and update EVERYTHING! I think I also have OCD

And its... just the HEAVYNESS in my arms while I perform! its like a demon is asking me to do it... or else...

I think its... ok... I think its OCD. I SWEAR its ocd!


No! For some reason I speak about random Fe grips I have but NOT OCD! GRRRRR!!!!

Comfort! I always go there after convincing myself I will only talk about unconfortable stuff but then just DONT


because my brain just forgets, obviously... because, while Fe grips can easly be relieved, as my psychologist is high in Fe, OCD is... lower level... its gutural... its.. neurological


I just think... its not ocd... embarassed about belief... because of the tidy stereotype... and I am afraid people wont believe me...


I also think I have microscopic panic attacks... that are always remaining microscopic because I feel them coming and then just stop what I am doing immediatly

When I am WAAAAYYY overextending myself. Like... when setting records for hours awake


Just... go to sleep. period.



Also happened when I was on a walk with a person I thought I loved... but it was so LETHALLY BORING! but I was scared of letting them down... I wanted to go do something else but kept repressing it

Like... and I always feel the lethal boredom next to people! Its all chew no flavour!


Almost all of them... when they are not... like me... but I dont wanna self segregate....
