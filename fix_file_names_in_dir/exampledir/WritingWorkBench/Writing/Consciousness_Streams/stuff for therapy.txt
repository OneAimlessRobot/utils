I follow a youtuber who shares psychological principles and gives us typical examples of situations where we benefit from them. Before, watching him felt like an active annoyance. I wanted to watch him. I wanted to apply all the principles. Felt like a main character. But now, It feels like an obligation, I go to his videos with a passive annoyance mindset and even if it is all useful and insightful, It feels like getting insulted or something.


It does not feel like failure gives us confidence. It does not. But the youtuber insists that it should. But it does not. I clearly feel more capable and determined after I get something right than if I get something wrong. If I get something wrong, I feel bad, innadequate and like I want to quit. It feels like I am getting gaslit.



Do you know what would be a great idea? A PC that turns on with a fingerprint sensor. Passord? Nope. Master Passord? Nope. Master Master Master.... Password? Nope. Already knows you. And then there is a separate power button.



Em aulas praticas de qualquer especie, fico super confuso em relação ao que fazer. Nunca sei se e quando devo praticar, ou anotar, ou ouvir.


...And then I did this personality test, and people usually hate people with my result: (according to their words, I dont use simpleton words like some of these) responsible, productive, not an overthinker, finds meaning in life itself, consistent.... they say its because they dont think hard enough to struggle, they are conformists who simply dont dream and just react reflexively like animals... And also I feel bad because I am not the genius one, or the special one or some dumb shit like that... why am I like this?
