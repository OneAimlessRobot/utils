I feel disgusted at myself

Hello. Its your boy Adriano again. Your local Grippy sock jail qualifying runner up, talking real and honest about himself. I look diagusting ok? My body... I dont like my body. I also have terrible nutrition habits. Well... all my eating habits are, pretty evidently, apalling. And I think I am developing anorexia! I skip meals, spend entire days without eating with the excuse of "spirituality" and I admit, that functionality happens. But... I do it intentionally ok? not because I am distracted or anything. Every day, I look at the mirror in the shower and see my ribs getting more and more visible... and... I feel glee from it. My arms are flabby, the legs I once prided on are flabby, my gut is visible and my body is all flabby and thin! Do you know what I look like? An african child! I look like I was born in chernobyl because of an accident! my body constitution and functional sturdyness are shit!  I am afraid... of tripping and falling on my ribs! I feel like the slightest thing will break me! Also... when people pinch my skin with lots of skin and it just... obeys... I feel so disgusted at myself... And... all I eat is fat! so... all I am is a disgusting bag of fat and bones! I look like a mutant out of Stalker or something! I wanna exercise... but Im lazy. I wanna cook... but Im lazy. I wanna exercise... idk run on the sand... but I dont like it. Yet... I am insecure about my body. The strength, the agility and the resistance. And I dont care about the cartwheels that I show to the randos I just met at the park! I hatw having xylophone ribs... I hate my body so much... So much... I just wanna stop being lazy... and just embrace that its gonna be hard at the start and that everything Im good at was hard at the start... I wanna be like a videogame character, you know? I dont wanna lose my face. I like my roundy face actually...but just be sturdy, small, compact, agile... like a peugeot 205 you know? like a 90s clio! and to not break into pieces when I trip! There is no symbolism. I. Hate. My. Body. Understand? How it functions and, to be blunt, How it looks, too! I wanna be a game character that just jumps around and flips... Im already so mentally resilient... I have a HUUUUGE physical endurance to actual hardware quality ratio... I just wanna feel like my body does not limit me... I dont wanna feel like paranoid that a simple, friendly, light gut poke will damage my stomach... ok? Or that stabbing me is like going through jello because of the fat. I hate my body.
I dont feel like its the end of the world though... There are alot of things I need to realize

Also... something I... L O A T H E, is being told, like... my god... to go to the beach. "Come on BRAAAHHH!!! GO TO THE BEEAAAACH!!!! SEE THA GAAAEEEERRRLLSSSS BRRRROOOOOOAAAAAA!!!!!!!! THA SAAAAANNNND! THAA BEEAAAAAACCHHHH!!!! THA BBQ!" Like... and the only thing they go off is... femtanyl on my phone, and my NAAAATURALLY, GENETICALLY, NOT-UNDER-MY-CONTROLLY, pale skin. I am pale and listen to femtanyl, so because of that, I get told CONSISTENTLY, by people WHO REFUSE TO OPEN THEIR MINDS, LIKE FUCKING RALLY DRIVERS THAT CRASH INTO THE SAME TREE OVER AND OVER, LIKE INFJs CHOOSING HEALTH CAREERS, LIKE BEN SHAPIRO MENTIONING LIBERALS, LIKE OSAKA BEING SPACEY... LIke... idk... bacteria behaviour... stuff like: "Bro! you should leave your room more! you should!". Bro. I do. I go out every day. EVERY DAY! And plus... its sunny outside! And I go to the park! And I try to understand and meet more people! People different from me, weird people, people I judge etc! And you tell me that? Like... Im done! bro! Im not being understanding with you! Your hopeless! there is no point! bro... get on my level ok? get on my level, read my mind, read my body, be inside my body whatever... get on my level, Do stuff that is actually HARD FOR YOU ONCE IN YOUR LIFE... not just NATURAL TENDENCIES THAT PEOPLE VALUE and GET ON MY LEVEL! Like... idk... GET BETTER! Get up here and then we talk ok? Like bro! some people are... naturally pale ok? is that so hard to understand? Like... I dont wanna go to the beach because... well... my beach stuff is in my hometown house and I dont wanna go get it, my hometown is actually close to the coast and BTW... the people there dont SUCK ASS! Like... I dont wanna ok? I could go buy some sun cream, a towel... BUT I DONT WANNA OK? Sigh...


Quick physical description of me? Im like an inverted tube of toothpaste filled only with skin, fat and bone with xylophone ribs and flabby bags of water attached to 4 corners. Oh! but I have a pretty face... *giggles*... I wanna prove to the world using only modern cutlery technology in innovative, straightforward methods, that push the boundaries of empirical science, that I am made, in fact, of just fat, skin and bone. If you stab me, it feels like stabbing a bag of edible, strawberry jello. I am disgusting and want to self serve myself for dinner....if any obese people want to become more so, that is...


Now ill let my ego run even wilder! Im tired of relying on some internet god for running my life. People irl arent just colder. they are also kinder. Grow some bal...samic compassion and purpose! (Happy face)

Right now... just... that I want to... not be too lazy to cook... DO you have ANY idea how frustrating it is? Like... I OUT LUNGED BODY BUILDERS ON A SOCCER MATCH WITH FRIENDS! I OUT LUNGED THEM! I COULD RUN WHEN THEY COULD NOT! There... is so much potential...

the right word for me isnt arrogant. its sassy
