I was in a bit of a rut a few hours ago. I had just watched a video about a psychiatrist talking about excessive venting. He told us about how people, especially nowdays get caught up in a vicious cycle of complaining and venting. People develop that as a mental habit and start feeding it by succumbing to escapism more and more eagerly, time and time again, until they become a shadow of themselves. I was confused and overwhelmed, because I related to it very much and, although I knew I was way better than before, At the time I watched the video, I really let it bring me down. I felt... ashamed. But after, ironically, several hours of binge watching youtube videos, I decided to go on Reddit. I opened up a subreddit called "sillyboyclub", which, rather simplistically, is where, unfortunately, over 8 thousand young people gather up to produce, although real, although relatable, important, authentic and raw, also very pessimistic, "venty" in a bad sense and self defeatist and sometimes bordering on enabling very disturbing beliefs and behaviours. Some people, though, also gather there to show kindness, direction and encouragement. Anyway.
. There was this kid who posted something titled: "Do you guys like art?" And... what I saw were incredible drawings. 6 of them. Passion, dedication, skill, talent. All there. I looked at them. Then I looked at the caption: "Please, can someone give me validation? Its quite literally the only thing I live off". And then, I remembered another one I saw a few hours earlier in my rut, of someone talking about how other people can animate and he cant and he can only manage to make a single coherent drawing in two hours... and why bother if they are thirteen and can conquer the world he is a nobody... all those words first started stinging me like viscious wasps, then started swirling inside my head like annoying mosquitoes
 Then... something clicked: I got fed up and I yelled at myself: "Omg talent, effort/low age, results/time, famous/maturity, talent/discipline, highiq/relative age, REALLLLY?????!!!!!!! BRO!!!!! I AM A F********ASS KICKER NOT A CALCULATOR!!!!!!!!!! I POSTED SO MUCH CRAP ON THAT SHITTY WEBSITE THAT GOT MOCKED, DELETED, INSULTED, MISUNDERSTOOD!!!!!! I KEPT GOING!!!!!! AND THAT BRILLIANT ARTIST WITH THE LOW SELF CONFIFENCE AND IMMERSED IN A CESSPOOL THAT ENABLES DESPAIR INDUCING BELIEFS, HE POSTS 6 DRAWINGS!!!!! WHAT IS UP WITH ME????!!!!!!! THATS IT!!!!! IM SOOOOOO SICK OF DOING FRACTIONS! And believed these words. And got  out of the rut.
