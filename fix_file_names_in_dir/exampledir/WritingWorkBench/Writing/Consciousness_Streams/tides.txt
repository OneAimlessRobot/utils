Tides:

From what I can see.... here goes. it may take a bit of time... when you are bored your brain fills up with useless stuff so its harder: "In this school... where talents are envied... where kids find it hard to keep up, two students debate over humility, generosity and self awareness: A girl and a boy. The girl... defendant and  fair, tries to lecture the boy, insensitive and bored. The boy just wants a challenge... I can understand that... but... hes just... i dont even know.... he... irks me.... he looks at me with that expression of 'how hes the best' or something... it... irks me... how can he be so convinced? I just wish I could be inside his head... for a second... this annoyance I feel... is the regret... of a curiosity... that will never be satiated."

smiles Im the vibe eater.



Im... the vibe eater! Thats why problems are easy... I pick up on the vibe... I just have problems articulating... Pretty much the only thing stopping me from solving a problem... is how much time I will take... to decode the vibe. When doing tests... dont you notice that I barely write stuff for like 20 minutes... to then fill out a page? Im slow.... my proof writting is confusing for teachers... they have to take it to math wizards in college... They cant understand all the functions I come up with... most people in class can barely conceive what a function is... I create them at will... and using all kinds of things... functions are verbs. objects are subjects. I speak math.

Im in the weirdo school after all...

You know what? I can look up personalized mentoring online... I guess Ill stay here in school to learn how to do teamwork at PE and for the socializing... and work in my mind elsewhere...

Wanna see me do a cartwheel? Like... for no reason?



does the most generic and prototypical cartwheel possible


Thats whats hard about it! looks like Im just animated in blender!


Oh... I also know how to do a front cartwheel... learned it from a 9 year old, african french, world class gymnast. My god her body is made of springs! She flips in the beach sand like its nothing! know how hard it is to run or even WALK in the sand? imagine FLIPPING!

yes! its from the genetics typically overlapping with african descendent people!

nah. Not any systems or causes. just pure statistics. And white people have terrible muscle building genetics. But we have better hand eye coordination! gamers are almost all white

Its what I see. I guess life just has to prove me wrong


I never claimed to be admant about my beliefs. Im not an IXXJ....



Come on! Why so serious? Im just yapping! come on! yap!


The world is complicated... what makes a conversation lighthearted... can set towns on fire too


Tides...


The world... is moved by tides... The tides move all around us, enveloping us, something beyond space and time... the will of god is a fluid that is between all objects. The essence of the world is time, space... and the will of god, making sure the simulation moves. The will of god moves masses, creates speech and communincation. Its the physics of the souls. Tides make you yap and me yap, some one listen and then to speak, someone kick a ball, score, run around... someone looks at them... the teacher notices and barely remembers that its class time... we already changed the future by 10 minutes... how long the teacher did not delay. then... we can go further: Then the tides affect other schools.... then those affect universities... the universities that scout talent... are gonna look at that teachers 10 minute delay, our yap and my grades and your grades... we already may have decided our future in a range of 2 years. the difference between ending up disappointed and burned out, and taking a gap year... going to college, just a bit too early... what adventures in the gap year? What adventures in college? What new friends will you find? The tides move.... and we cannot stop them.


In gods playground, the space is the geometry and entities, time is the ticks and frames rolling... tides... are the instructions being executed... and what moves them? God himself.

Damn... Im so gonna miss highschool...



Even the bitch princesses... I wanna talk to them... But... just being around them is so unbearable! I know... I know... superficial, they lack connection, they lack meaning, they lack self assuredness... narcissism... everyone just fears them... but I dont care... its just unbearable to me...


I think they are people who are in jungian Pe Je loops



No. Extroverted perceiving (any) and Extroverted Judging (any)


No... its just: "boring... boring... boring... boring... YOU SUCK... boring.... YOU SUCK... boring... like... bitch? get a hobbie like come on!"

I consider your point, understanding where you're coming from

"I see what you mean. It makes sense that extraverted perceiving (EP) and extraverted judging (EJ) personality types might be more prone to getting stuck in the loop you mentioned. EPs are often focused on seeking novelty and stimulation, which could lead to a cycle of boredom and constant seeking of external validation. EJs, on the other hand, are often concerned with external structures and order, which could lead to a cycle of criticism and attention-seeking behavior."

I am IP... I have suffering too: I get stuck in  Ji- Pi loops


yes! just: "uh! a fact! cool.... uh! a fact! cool.... uh! a fact! cool...."


No! and its not just that its insight dwelling: its dwelling ON THE SAME STALE STUFF!


yes... What temperament are you in MBTI?



Also Pi Ji loops?



Like... when I come up with a very cool vibe description and people dont care I feel shattered...


SEE? What? just rude? Wait... does that mean you were... offended? or That I was just being... objectively inconsiderate and performing badly in socialization?


Then... ok. What is the context for me to get offended? Oh! its investment.... maybe you were just spitting vibes... but the vibes were not particularly interesting to you so you just thought my replies were weird


But... ok. Im gonna be honest: I think the flags... I dont like the flags. its like... something needs confirmation to be ok. And they wave it everywhere! "LOOK AT US! WE KNOW WE ARE DIFFERENT! BUT WE ARE THE SAME AS YOU!" Ok.. wait... looking back... yeah fair enough. but the colors... I dont like all the colors... I can fuck a bi girl without so many colors like come on!

Like... IXFPs are just cinnamon rollish... on the surface. You dig deeper and suddently find rock... and they they will just blushes toy with you
