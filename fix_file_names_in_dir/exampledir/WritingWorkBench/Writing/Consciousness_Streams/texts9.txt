I am a huge drama queen... and there is nothing wrong with that. I have to accept the part of me that likes to get emotional and intense

Bro... Im so sorry... But im not kidding bro... im just better... its facts bro just accept reality

I am the dark, darkly, dark, darkness, dark lord living beneath the... realm... in the darkly, dark, darkness pit of darkly, dark, darkness at the twisted, mad, madness alleyway


Bro you know jack all about my life... I do go outside, so get on my level! (I have to try really hard... if I dont I just slip off the cliff of isolation again... what? No... nothing MBTI related here Im just a shutin trying to get better)

Aw hell naw (skull emoji) (metal pipes explode in a hellish cacofony)


when I care about musical genre, I like jumpstyle, "Maidcore" (I like pretty maids doing pretty, post metal maid s***), very, very, very over the top and agressive ahh metal emo rock f*** s***, caterpillar songs, dnb and emotional hardstylw mixes. Oh! Also whatever the f*** femtanyl is.

I am a person with a very Organy, watery, meaty, bloody, physiological and bony body and a very mushy and neurological brain

I am a disgusting, small, weak, ratty, lavender and grey moth filled with only dust on the inside that is spec built for stealthy, indirect emotional manipulation and barely survives daily by taking sips from the blood of actually valuable  people

I LOVE analyzing people and trying to predicit what they will do... ive been getting better and its cool to see peoples reactions when I get it right... I feel soo good when I get it right

Ok: When I hear "computer virus", I think about, obviously computers, computer science, programming and software engineering. But also... social manipulation, inventiveness, cleverness, an eye for understanding things at a deep level. Also a sharp sense for tactics, driven by an urge to operate in the middle of the grey areas of whats annoying and whats destructive. People who decide to create computer viruses are either curious, malicious, mischiveous, are doing it for a vision or are simply testing their own systems. The potential for variety in computer viruses is immesurable: Make a huge "malloc" without "free" To using dates to activate specific payloads. In more concrete terms, I think of messy bedrooms, quake, doom, the C programming language, visual basic, tube monitors, large companies... Also debatable morality and high stakes investigations. Computer viruses have a soft spot in my heart because I think they are beautiful. Its also not easy to make one thats actually useful. You need to be both clever and willing to take advantage of the systems you attack. Also... UAC in windows. Making viruses in Linux is not that hard... as you have almost full control of your machine... yet not many people make them, as not many people dont use Linux. I began learning about computer science and programming, starting with C, 3 years ago and its been quite a journey. And what motivated me to start was how beautiful the videos about viruses looked. I like the MEMZ virus, the Magistr virus and the Twitch booster virus.



Ok Ive figure out one reason for why I loathe not being on metilphenidate so much when I forget to take it: The sheer... restlessness... lack of patience... just whirlwind of emotions inside me... the PURE AMOUNT OF TIME I take to have meals... the feeling that Im just sailing on breezes of air... just... feeling like a feather in a hurricane mentally... the sheer inability to be patient is the worst though... patient is not just a sin for the brother. Its a sin for the self. Being impatient feels like ass


Ok. I found out what part of the mind ADHD actually affects and a better way to see it not just as a scattered series of symptoms: It affects the ego. No... not the "Omg I cannot disappoint them" Part of the brain. No... not the "This is embarassing" part of the brain. Thats the super ego. Example of stuff that comes out of the ego: "Wow! thats soo cool!" "Look! An apple!" "Hey! What does that mean?" "Does this fit here?" "This tastes like orange.". And ADHD is a sort of... different type of ego right? Or a quirky ego? What I am trying to ask is: Are ADHD and certain mbti types HEAVLY linked?
