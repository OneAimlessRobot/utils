My YT channel:


My football celebration will be me running into the center of the pitch, possibly flipping and waving in a goofy way, centering myself in the 'relvado', checking my legs apart a little bit, hunching my body down, tightning my arms, joining them with curled fists and throwing my arms in the air, like stretching in the morning, but more brashly. all while I have my pampering teamates praising me with gestures  and vows like the theatrical, flashy, overconfident and delicate flower that I f***ing am!

My first video was a test. The wheelie glitch in gran turismo 3. The next was the setup. Next was making a Gran turismo sport for a mclaren Gr3 car livery using sponsors from local shops in Lourinhã. Do you know Lourinhã?

Because I live there. And also back in 2019 I made videos of me testing viruses made by me in virtual machines

I will boot up Need for Speed Most wanted 2005. Grind, buy a bunch of cars. I have a theory: I think Either fwd cars or the starter cars are OP in the game. Because In an example track in career mode, a tollbooth from Taz, the perfect time for a Fully bulked up RX8 is a 1:36. But for a corvette is a 1:33. For a lotus elise is 1:32. Then... for a fully bulked up Ford Gt is a 1:30. Do you wanna guess for a VW Golf GTI? 

1:30, 1:31, you say? No.

1:27. 2 attempts. It felt easier to drive too. Did not go through any adversity to get that time


The next step is to try the punto



A song started playing. Jisatsu Manyuaru. A song... of peace. melacholy that eventually snapped you. You are now a dead person walking... among the ones that feel alive. You see the universe in every corner of your eyes. The stars in the night sky feel inches away from you. You lay under a street post after one more overdose outside your building. You admire everything with a glint of fascination and awe in your eyes, not dead, not alive. neutral. You cant speak. You cant walk. You can only... see. before you prepare yourself to commit it, you take in all that you can from this sole night, just so... you can greedly carry everything that you love... to the pearly gates. You were a good person Ester. None of what you every did... was wrong.


I played a song every time I visited. I was supposed to be validation. To confirm your biases. To make catharsis quicker... like therapy. It was Dehydrate, by Yakui the Maid. It was a synth rock hybrid thing. It was a whole  and exact 8 minutes long. The sounds... filled with slow stumbling  coord sequences, full of melancholy. melancholy that almost turn to nihilism... it felt almost empty... but not quite... dehydrate but not... dehydrate....ed. Like... a river... a river full of water that was dirty, white like the liquid they were injecting you to keep you nourished, smelly, stale, thick... worn down... warm... partially dried up... bubbly from pollution... all in a heat wave sunny day, in india. The feeling of rotting in a hospital bed, the feeling of having insects crawl at you but not bothering... letting yourself being digested by the earth, returning to where you belong... the earth... looking up at the night sky, full of stars, surrounded by a temperate forest, in Leiria, Portugal, full of tall, thin trees... we can see a path. there are cycadas, moths... they all land on you... take a sip from your tears and sweat... and leave. You lay there... letting the absurdity of existence take over... as you meld with the blue planet, like human mould
Ive listened to it... just laying in bed... no music... no clothes... no blankets in a summer heat wave afternoon... shutters and doors and windows locked... like a piece of meat contained in a wooden box... staling away through life... waiting until it completly melds with the earth


I cannot play the same game as an IXXJ, because I was not created an IXXJ... I am an IXXP, an ISFP. I struggle with pragmatism. It irks me when people overwhelm me with direction. It wears me down. Im a special ed at using my extroverted thinking. So, while still staying eager to improve, people will have to accept me and support me that way. Thats how the world works. Thats reality. we are not in caveman land anymore. Human races biggest current problem, is not survival of the finest, its thriving in harmony


You make stuff look easy your own way. Im gonna tell you a story of a security guard at my building... Shes quite the person. here it goes. Her name is Susana, 40 years old. She is pragmatic, smart, no nonsense and with a sharp witty humor. She enjoys confort and struggles with rigidity. We had a conversation yesterday, about me donating to a street artist. She said: "That artist has no job. Tell him to find a job and use your money for something else, kid". It... made me so irked out... She was accidentally bashing me with her Te so brutally... She thought she was clearing my head up... it was making me spin around furiously... So... I was like: "But... what even is a job?".... We went back and forth... I kept trying to change her. She was defending herself... A part of me was like: "OMG the stupid judgy IJs strike again... can you belive this god? Ugh..." But... after we changed topic and I went for dinner... I realized: It wasnt her trying to change me. I was the one trying to change her. She was already under so much stress.. and she did not understand MBTI... so she was pratically defending herself from a predator. A predator that knew her weaknesses... I was trying to force her into not being am IJ... like an idiot Reddit blogger... She already had cancer, was all patched and tubed up with a hole through her intestines to a bag in her waist... so she could defecate. she could only eat liquid gels that you usually see cyclists take. yet... she came to work.... every day... thats where the weakness came from... I did not talk to zero people... I spoke with her. She was the only person I spoke to during that month

I dont wanna go anywhere near an ISTJ now. They look like rocks. Well... they are not. they are not. No one is...

The way the internet portrays them... I dont care if its just the internet... we all just see them as some dumb robot that can just sit there and take it. But they can do it, not because they are invulnerable... but because they are warriors.

And what am I doing? just smelling flowers and writing poetry all day... while they just shut up and work like adults... What am I doing...


Ok: she kept telling me: "Look! The street artist does this! and does that! look! outside! look at what he is doing! outside! outside! outside! he does not give you a receit! hes clearly a criminal! how dont you get it? (she is on par with financial stuff knowledge... she is a 40 year old woman with a job) But she keeps telling me to look at the puzzle pieces and being like: "COME ON! ASSEMBLE IT YOU R WORD!" (ok not like that shes actually nice) but it kept confusing me like: "what the hell is she after? im so out of this dude..." And then she as Te that irks me!!!! I WAS FEELING VERY STRESSED BECAUSE SHE WAS CHUCKING TE AND NE AT ME!!!!!" Im right right?

Like.... she kept throwing Ne insights like "LOOK! a fact a fact and another fact!!! come on! Assemble the vibe! connect the dots!!!" But im not him I cant do what she is asking me to so, because she was stressed and getting jumpy (but not actually angry though) and unconfortable because, although she is 40, her Ne is still inf and She struggles when she has to sue it, She kept chucking at them with no moderation at all! And what I did was, almost every second (shit felt like I was lagging like omg it felt like s***), per individual fact she threw at me from her Ne, I kept trying to make a ntree with those facts that reaches to god knows where and because she kept throwing them at me I could not think or reply! And She had the Te too that absolutely Irks me when combined with The rest of the ISTJ package!!!!!! So I felt like I was lagging, Im 22 and very artsy and not pragmatic so I had no clue what she was trying to teach me, I had to keep my cpu spinning at 100% just to make sense of 1 thing at the time without even being able to assemble anything together after because she was just machine gunning me, She looked upset at me and I dont like conflict.... Sigh.... I hated that... I hated that so much...
