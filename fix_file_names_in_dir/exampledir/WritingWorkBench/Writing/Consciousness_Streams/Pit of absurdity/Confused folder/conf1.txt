Confused insights/questions:


what... is humanity?

ignorance is bliss, just like confusion, not knowledge. Knowledge means stopping time. If time stops, existence stops.


Just because conventional education requires less autonomy, it does not mean its easier.


Tough love statement within a confusion driven society: "No son. In this world, you dont get to be sure of yourself and have guarantees. You only get a chance, for a hint at a possibility for an opportunity to hopefully reach a theorized outcome. And thats ok."

Basically... I dont cry if... in one month everything is fine and in the next, I have 50 euros in absolute total and shrinking, bills to pay and food to buy, being at the mercy of social services to even be able to continue life moving forward.

One evolves by being able to, courageously, switch between one attitude and another. Know when to back down when your ideas are too stale or innadequate is vital. But you should defend them to the bitter end as well.

"you should be confident in yourself... I never said "dont have an identity" I just said: "Recognise that identity is fleeting... but always try to have one""


"It gives you confidence to ask questions, to be wrong, to explore without judgement..."

But if confusion totally takes ove, we will fall in dark times. Thats why I stated that identity is important, albeit fleeting

I think its reasonable to rely on the established if one feels its adequate or if its just the least hassleful thing to do in general. But I am not criticizing established theories themselves. Just overreliance on them.

Confusion is not the point. Its the tool.

Being confused... what do you do when you are confused? What does your brain push you into doing? yes! Asking questions! Thats how humans should operate! Always seeking more and more and more... never delluding themselves with dreams of permanent certainty

We should always rest. But like an artpiece you work on, you have to be resilient enough to accept when it isnt done yet.

Indeed, resilience is an important trait to cultivate when facing confusing or difficult situations. However, I am concerned that the constant pursuit of confusion and exploration could lead to a kind of nihilism. If we always reject the established ideas and beliefs, we might risk losing touch with reality and even losing our grip on what is right and wrong, true and false.
For example, if a student is taught that 2+2 is equal to 5, and they reject that idea because it's established, what's to stop them from believing that 2+2 is always equal to 17?

By challenging them.

I agree with your approach, but let's play devil's advocate here. If the student is adamant that 2+2 is always 17, how far should you push back? At what point do you risk losing their trust and respect? How do you ensure that the student doesn't feel discouraged or disheartened by constantly pushing back on their ideas?

I say... just let the strongest idea win.

Hmm... so, you are saying that the most compelling idea should be embraced, regardless of the established facts or norms? That idea has its merits, but I wonder what happens when established ideas are correct? If we were to say that the Earth is round, yet someone else adamantly claims otherwise, how do we decide which idea is the stronger one? What does strength mean in this context? Is it determined by logic, emotion, evidence, popularity, or something else entirely?

if the facts are established... them being broken down should only come after making sure the person has a grip on what steps they are taking

I do agree that challenging established facts should take the form of a gradual, well-reasoned process, not just a reckless denial of reality. But I worry that even in this context of careful and incremental dismantling, the line between challenging established facts and denying reality is thin and can easily escalate into nihilism and chaos. How do we ensure that the process remains controlled and structured?

They should be taken to stronger, and stronger opposition... gradually more refined thinkers to challenge the students beliefs.

That's an interesting approach. By exposing the student to increasingly challenging perspectives, you are gradually expanding their understanding of the world and encouraging them to think more critically and deeply about things. That is a healthy mindset to cultivate. However, I worry that this process can quickly devolve into the student feeling overwhelmed and confused by the various perspectives they are exposed to. How would you navigate this potential pitfall?

By telling them to be honest with themselves when they find one that they agree with. And if they dont find one, if their perspective is the least empirically proven, they should be willing to yield and just sit quietly with humility

I do agree that honesty and humility are crucial for self-reflection and growth. But... I'm curious... what happens if the student still refuses to budge even after all that? What if they truly believe that 2+2 is always equal to 17? It doesn't matter that every expert and authority figure on the topic tells them otherwise, they steadfastly cling to their belief. What then? How would you address this persistent resistance to change?


Uhhhh... Hey! Yes! We could try to come up with that by a darwinian process of sorts. People who challenge those facts could be awarded loads of cash or something


My confusion thing is basically a call for society to maximize Ti. But Te is also important.




Basically... our debate is an epic confrontation, where two thinkers of equal weight and wit go blow for blow. One... Te. Another... Ti.


her argument is very good: What if someone deeply believes, in a world where 5+5 = 69, that it isnt 69, but 68? Should we just challenge their internal reasoning? What if they got there because their basics are all wrong? Thats where I come in, considering her angle: We should establish some basic laws, through a darwinian process, that the challenge should be able to challege for them to change


Accepting that this competition is an important part of life is how both will find a common ground

And if they challenge those beliefs in like 1st grade... GOOD! It means school struck gold and found a wonder kid
