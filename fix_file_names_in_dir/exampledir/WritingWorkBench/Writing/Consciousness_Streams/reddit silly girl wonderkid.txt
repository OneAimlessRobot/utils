I am bored. So I open up Reddit. I check the usual stuff... Okay buddy Baka, ShittyMBTI, hopeposting, sillyboyclub. But then... its time... to check... sillygirlclub. There are alot of key players to watch on that team like "Got too silly" and many others. But one stands out for me:  fembrainedschizo. She runs from the middle of the pitch, after finding an opening: dribbles past one through sheer originality, another through sheer dark feminine vibes, another throuhh sheer authenticity. Then she is 1x1. She shoots and with sheer madness she SCORES!!!! EVEN HER FANS GO SILENT! SHE HAS BEEN unstopabble this season. Others look everywhere in disbelief! Her teamates join her in celebration!  She has been ON FIRE! Most goals and sucessful dribbles in a season! Its another BANGER of a post to recall fondly! A legend of the club! There is simply no stopping this woman!
