I just... hit rock bottom. I got stuck in the pit of despair and depravity. I looked down on my own wish to thrive then I traded my ambitions for cheap thrills. I had promissed myself I would be my family's home. A refreshing presence, a protector and a dreamer. They all trusted me. I then abandoned myself, and began a journey of self-harm powered by masochistic pleasure. I gave in to the fear of death and began... yearning....for it. Not anymore! I saw what the extremes of insanity and agony look like. I felt them. Its not that fun. Its not that sweet. It just feels like a constant cyclone made of razor blades, getting ocasional flashes of pleasure as you gradually approach your demise. I must take back my vitality, I must seek alone time, and bring myself back to that special place that only I know, so that everyone that loves me can feel safe living in me again. The wind took almost everything that I had away from me. Now all I want is to make it right.


I will ignore all my self made misery and then repeat to myself as I engrave it in my soul "I am strong. I am strong. I am strong. I am strong.". Its all that I have left. Its the only way forward. Its all I was ever meant to do. To unite all my muscles, to turn my fractured self into a moving unit. To become whole.
