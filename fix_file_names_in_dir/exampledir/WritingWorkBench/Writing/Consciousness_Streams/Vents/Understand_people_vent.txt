Humanity... Its soo deep and real... and ethereal at the same time... people say I dont understand emotions... and Yet I still try to. I make art, I make writtings, I experience nostalgia and describe it... But... because I cant talk to stupid girls or stutter when nervous... it means I dont understand. What do you have to tell me then? WHat do you have in your head that makes it so easy for you to read people like fiddles? To have women wrapped around you? Whatever the fuck that is supposed to serve you... whatever the fuck that is suposed to mean for you as a human. I ask... what is it? What is it? Because... I was like you? I was trying... at first predatorially... but then... curiously... and then... in a sweaty, obcessive way... I WANTED TO understand people... I put ALL OF MY COMBINED NEURONS INTO ACHIEVING THAT!!!!!!! But... When I found myself finnaly able to talk to a friend That was too busy to talk to me for over 2 years... Med school, Travelling to the US... experiencing life so intensly like I did... We could have connected so well... but this DISGUSTING urge to understand her... she tried to answer so honestly... She praised my insights... but... Its impossible. I cant understand people ok? I cant understand people. I cant. I cant. I cant. ICanticancticant ok? Its impossible. Its impossible and no one is smart enough. No one is. Smart. Enough. Because there is no logic that will ever solve the deep, raw experience of connection with another soul. There is no system. No machine. No concotion. No theory. No law. All we do is measure... and try. And measure... and try. And people... always resist. Psychology... is the epitome of the futile human urge to understand. Understand what? What is there to understand? What is humanity? Do we even know? What are these relationship gurus suposed to tell me ABOUT MY DEAREST FRIENDS????!!!!! I HATE THEM! THEY MUST ALL DIE FOR THE SIN OF IGNORANCE! I WANT THEM DEAD! I LOATHE THEM! I KNOW! BUT IM JUST A WEIRD AUTISTIC KID! NOW MAN! I DONT KNOW SHIT ABOUT EMOTIONS... Yet... Im the only person I know... who is trying to resist the urge... to undertand what was never meant to be it.

I shall be ignorant. I shall... not understand. Because... ignorance is bliss... not because the ignorant are privileged. But because they are wise.

This all feels... like a storm I MUST endure. Fuck understanding. I shall struggle instead.
