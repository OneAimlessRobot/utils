ADD and ASD vent:


As I sit in my room looking at my phone, at home... my non college home, Staring at the time. 16:27. september 10, 2024. Its almost time to return to college. "What will I learn? Will I get myself together? Will I learn how to negotiate my essence with those of others? Who will I disappoint? Who will I make proud? Will It be....fun?" Well... it always is... boredom... feels overwhelming. A total storm of tears and laughter is what my teachers always expect to bear... when they see me pass by. An emo and a brat. A fighter and a child. Its been a long, long, long time since I was born. It has been... 22 years. I came out a drunk woumb.... with people around me doubting if I was even gonna be born functional. And then... I was. I definitely was. And fought for a slot in society's multiple niches... looking for a way to map out my neurological, physical... mental self. Am I... an athlete? A nerd? A viber? A bitter soy boy? I crafted many characters... vibes captured that live and think... have friends wishes and souls and dreams... those who overcome trauma and suicide... those with pathologies... those who are irredeemably tragic. And there I am... a normal guy from a remote village in portugal. Looking within I find nuances in the planet people just wont get people wont recognize. Atop the mountain, I stare at the abyss. So much has been explored... So much has been lived. No regret... no fear... Lots of anxiety... lots of bitterness... lots of vulnerability with wounds. Tainting the world around me with the blood of my gaping inch thick scratches, my 4 finger deep wounds in my chest... from flurries and flurries... from the winds of blades that Ester throws, That psych2go casts into tornadoes and Atomic bombs...
Exploring endlesly until I find what Lies beneath... made in an abyss of turmoil, nostalgia, longing and excitement, my soul breathes outward... and like any other soul... It refuses containment. It refuses pidgeon holing. People who dont get defensive... are not zen. They are sick. I look into the horizon... after walking for thousands of miles... many people joining with me, helping me... helping me up ledges. So much of my soul... materialized into text? Is it... all real? Is it all... me? So much I dug out, so much left for the world to see. Neverending exploration is my minds fuel. Questions my shots of nitrous. Curiosity my engine. Hope my tires. Through roads I bravely know, push forward, unrellenting. The vibes, the nuances. Old and new people. All varied... all complex. All fascinating. A fan of life is what I am. Obcessively searching for what cannot be seen, described or even discerned. For the unknown. Desperately scrambling for empty space on the pitch... space to slot in, space to occupy with my ideas, habilities and needs. Hopeful continuation. So now... even with the knowledge that I will turn old soon, in about 7 years we will switch decades... But... for the last 2 years... Ive done nothing but live, struggle and laugh. So thats What I shall keep doing. The imminent decade switch is innevitable, like time itself, like death and aging... but... if for just 2 years life felt never ending and I even gained some knowledge... knowledge I actually use... why would... 7 years feel short? I just know... without a single spec of doubt in my mind, each year of the next 7 will feel like a complete eternity. There is just... so... so much left to shift, to evolve. I will me reborn and die countless times... I will try and fail. Be stuck and push through... like a Mechanical Starfish... like a Persistent, Pragmatic Prototype. M.S.P.P.P. Thats the political party I vote for The gaping wounds coming and going just like my friends and passions... my fears. My enemies turn into friends... I question my biases and those of others... an eternal time trial is what I competr in. So now... I look at my future, not with dread... albeit with uncertainty, with waryness of all the possible hardships... And I stand firm... in face of the monster... that is my essence. Hopeful continuation... is my purpose. Its ethereal. But its mine. "How are you feeling?" Hopeful. And uncertain. Chronically deathless. Thats how I feel now. Felt before. And always will.  Every day... I live more and more densely... my existence expanding in complexity like a runaway shockwave. Like how life on earth flourished, I expand in nuance and complexity at breakneck pace... My emotions... I bounce back up, skyrocket... and then sink deep... way down, surfing the many contours and textures of my inner landscape... trying to make sense of it all... at every drop and rise... every path leading to new mental homes... to each person that rallies me up... and from me to them too... them too explorers like me... Gordon Freeman... Ashito Aoi, Filippo Inzaghi, Osaka, Hatsune Miku, Tomoko, Lain, Yakui the Maid, Alok, Filipa, Leyla, Otomo, Kenta, Komak the Maid... Ana... Those Men and Women mixed within my soul are my scouts. My loyal searchers for new opportunities, for chances... for space not yet filled by anyone else. So now... I must go. I will dip my pen in the blood of my most recent wound... and paint a canvas using its blood. Goodbye.

So... where will you go today?
