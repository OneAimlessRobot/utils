Alright... this is a rant for WOMANS! ok? If you identify partly, or totally or are just confused in general... and are fixated on wearing "Girl" shit... Like... my god... you are not A FUCKING DOOOOLLLLLLLLL!!!!! USE YO NOGGIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did this too, ok? I am no mister revolution or anything... but... IT PISSES ME OFF! Notions like.... "Girl" clothes... "Winter" clothes... "Summer" clothes... that just stiffle both our values and our practicality oriented reasoning. Its summer. Its fucking summer. I, as it is natural to happen, felt COLD during the summer! Right? its as much a possibility for me as it is for you an anyone ever in the history of the planet of the earth. Then... I FELT COLD... AND SOOO OFTEN HAD THIS SUBCONSCIOUS BELIEF "Dont wear a jacket! what are you? Weird? its summer! no jacket! no jacket!" And guess what: today... I challenged that belief and... NO ONE CALLED ME WEIRD FOR WEARING A JACKET PAIRED WITH SHORTS IN THE SUMMER! OK? I did not die of cringe or embarrassment or whatever! I am physically capable of that! AAAAAANNNND... Ladies that complain about the absolute trash, dumb, DISASTER in the shoe kingdom that is... whoever came up with the sickening torture device known as "High heels", DONT MAKE A TRIBUTE FOR THEM! Like... Im just gonna lay down the facts: If the situation isnt one where, like, 1- you ACTUALLY, GENUNELY, Like using them (Which is valid) or 2- Your boss is gonna fire you from the only reasonably accessible work you ever had access to and could have access to in the foreseeable future, Then... D O N T. There is no "Girl clothes", There is no "Summer clothes". (But there is formal clothes... Which is gonna be hard to change...). But... try to play with the idea of wearing highheels as LITTLE as POSSIBLE so that they EVENTUALLY DISAPPEAR FOREVER AND EVER! Because... if your boyfriend or hubbie has a feet fetish and its summer, WEAR SANDALS GOD DAMNIT!!!!!!! THE FOOT IS NAKED DURING SEX! YOU DONT NEED TO WEAR HIGHHEELS AS A LOGICAL TRUTH! OK???!!!!!!! Its this thing, a deprecated bone of fashion that should disappear and people are not BOTHERING! AT LEAST WEAR THOSE RATHER COMFY Women versions of Mens formal shoes! Not HIGHHEELS! THOSE ARE SHIT! SHIT! OK? DONT! DONT! DONT BE STUPID! I had a crush on Highschool... I thought she was fucken beatyful. She was practical, logical, comfort oriented in her dressing code... and I swear by my limbs that I genuenly admired her! I thought she was beautiful! Ok? her face... her body... her mannerisms... personality... YOU DONT NEED STUPID, OUTDATED CLOTHING TO BE SEXY AND HOT AND BASED AND QUEEN OR WHATEVER THE FUCK!! USE YOUR NOGGIN!!!!!! OKKKK????

My crush... in my dream... where she mocked my loserness... she opened my eyes... to what was trully holding me back. The urge... to defeat absurdity. Kafka... was right. Defeating Absurdity may be a valliant struggle... but... its futile.

I am also a Man, girlies. "Babies? WE EAT BERRIES AND MUSHROOMS YOU FOOL!"

Rant... over.
