Lil git menace: 


Ok I gotta talk about a lil git I found when on a WALK! So anyways... I am on a walk to LOOK AT PEOPLE AND SHIT!!!! OUTSIDE!!!! I LIVE IN THE SEMI RURAL PORTUGAL MID CENTRE! ANYWAY!!!!! So.... I head to the football court to look at the big boys play (Ok Im 22 and they are all like 18 and 19 BUT I LOOK FUCKING 16 ok? its not weird from the outside so ANYWAY) And they are NOT PLAYING LIGHTLY MY GUY!!!!! You just had to be there... they were playing ROUGHT! The fucking torpedos they were shooting, the way they were tackling eachother and they could take it all on the chin too! The level of physicality was UP TO THE STARS! And its not just phisycal! they were all just throwing away feints and flicks like NOBODYS BUSINESS! And they were pretty good in terms of awareness TOO! SHIT LOOKED LIKE TV FUTSAL BRO! BUT 7v7 instead of 5v5!!!!! BROOO! YOU HAD TO SEE SOME OF THE GOALS! And because its all surrounded by huge thick metal wire fences , they could just shoot as hard as they want! And some guys were HUGE! IMAGINE JUST GOING INSIDE BROOOO!!!!!!! Like... if you dont feel like you are at their level you just dont go in PERIOD! They were nice people but MY GOD WATCHING THEM PLAY WAS BOTH INTIMIDATING AND FASCINATING! ANYWAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! So.... 2 lil gits want to get in to play right? Like... first of all: both of them look BARELY AS BIG AS THE BALL ITSELF! Second... I told them: "look! youre like 3 foot. your arm is the thickness of that guys big foot toe! YOUR GONNA GET PIECED UP LIL BRO!" hes like: "Ok and?" And JUST WALTZES IN Like... in his like 5 year old voice. (He is INSIDE while saying it): "Hey! can i pway pwease?" And they obviously stop! So then they obviously try to reason with them saying: "Look! We are too big for you kids... we can hurt you... Why dont you g-" AND LIL BRO POUTS AT THEM LIKE HES BEING INSULTED! So then he relucantly leaves... But HE COMES BACK DOING THE SAME THING 20 MINUTES LATER! BRO HAS NO SENSE OF SELF PRESERVATION! SO ANYWAYYYY!!!!!! the big guys stop playing, I then play with the little kid... because I am not fast, I suck ass and I am a pretty good teacher, and try to teach him some simple feints... AND LIL BRO CAN DO ALL OF THEM! HES 5!!! 5!!!!! BRO IS OP! BRO HAS TO BE NERFED! Ok. following?


Ok so I meet him the next day right?  Bro... is PLAYING WITH THEM! And guess what? HES PUTTING UP A FIGHT! NO! HE IS M A T T E R I N G! I could not MATTER IN PE SPORTS WITH KIDS MY AGE! LIL GIT IS HIM!!!!!! ANYWAYYY!!!!!! Then lil git actually does a good... PASS!! Bro is COOOLLLD!!!!!!!! And Then.... ok I have to tell you precisely WHAT this game has to offer us: First of all: One guy can hold the ball with his foot in the air like hes spooning up some rice and the throw it LIKE AN EGG WITH A SPOON LIKE 10 meters, another is in shape BUT BARELY RUNS DUE TO HOW MUCH GAME SENSE HE HAS, then another kid is objectively the best player ive ever seen in person outside a stadium, bro could do trials for real... then another guy has the body of a literal top tier college weight thrower in the lighter weight classes, and he has some interesting skills too, then another one, who is actually pretty chill I talked to him, then another kid that had a manchester shirt on... bro was a bit bad not gonna lie! But he tried! and then theres the little git. bro was lowkey running more than anyone else in the GAME! AND HE ONLY LOST DUE TO BODY DIFFERENCE! AND HE SHIT TALKS HIS TEAMATES WHEN THEY SUCK! WHAT? WHO IS THIS KID? And then... another menace: btw Im outside I aint stepping in unless they stop! NO WAY! But theres the girlfriend of one guy... and, in a game with no balls out, (they can bounce of the walls of the court and stuff...), the girl is standing IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EDGE OF THE COURT! LIKE... JUST MESSAGING HER GIRLIE FRIENDS! BRO! WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? THEY STARTED BUILDING THEM LIKE MENACES AGAIN! And then we return to lil git! bro saw life flash before his eyes when one of the big guys just tackled him, HE GOT UP AND WENT AFTER HIM! I swear... lil git weights the same AS THAT BIG GUYS BREAK FAST!!!!!! BROOOO!!!!


Bro... I wish I was born like him... But I also like myself. We are both cool! but hes also cool!


I like writting about menaces like lil git or even characters I come up with, I like programming with cool ideas I come up with, I like playing racing games with ideas I come up with, and making cool car concept builds in gran turismo (Like the really hard to control but really potent toyota 'yandere' supra I made a while ago), And... looking and people and s***!!!!!!!!!!!


I want to create a story where an actual psycho and a very silly girl meet in a cycling race to save sports! The psycho has friends and the silly girl has friends too! At first they are all teams competing against eachother for a cause, but then they all, collectively "FUCK YOUR CAUSES LEADERS!" And just go all out amongst themselves!


I swear man lil git is gonna be literally david goggins when he grows up!!!!!

And remember the really good player? Like the GUY EVEN stressed a little bit to get past lil bro!

And then lil git was standing his ground so well against the enemy teams attack that he made the other player with the spoon feet... B A C K  P A S S !

And then... there was a moment where he RAN WITH THE BALL! Of course ... in that situation, a leg from a player is the size of the WHOLE OF HIM! so its easy to stop him but BRO WAS RUNNING ON THE WING LOOKING FOR A FUCKING CROSS!!!!

And then people say we are getting worse at sports... BRO WE HAVE LIL GITS AND Old TEENAGERS THAN PLAY LIKE TV FUTSALL!!!!!!! WHAAAT YOU SAY?????!!!!

But lets not get ahead of ourselves... they were obviously holding back on him a little... because of course they were... but... even then...


Idk... heres my top 5 fave players: 1- Filippo Inzhagi. 2- hartem ben arfa. 3- PEPE!!!!! 4- Buskets. 5- iniesta

Lil git is literally pepe...


Sporting, Porto, or Benfica? PORTOOOOO!!!! HERES WHY!!!!!!!

Bro! first of all: their jerseys are always gorgeous (Biased by my aesthetic taste). Second of all: First football crush. Third of all. Im Portuguese. fourth of all: MOURINHO! fifth of all: 2003-2004 NEVER FORGET!


So today I was on a walk to go play football with the guys from the other day right? I saw them all gather... and lil git was there... but there was one player missing. I wasnt aware yet, so I went there to high five lil git for last time and then... he starts counting players... her realizes they are 1 player short... and then... he turns to me... saying: "Olha... falta jogadores. queres jogar por favor!" me: "Olha... v- v- vamos esperar por mais alguem pode s-" Him: "Por favor!" me: "Esta bem... pronto... vou jogar ate aparecer mais alguem... ok? mas se aparecer mais alguem eu saio logo!" I went to put my bag in a safe spot... and went to a bunch of players to warn them: "Hey... Im gonna play UNTIL SOMEONE COMES OK? But let me warn you: I kinda suck ok? I suck ok? ok?". So then... they let me play. I start playing and, although begrugingly, I begin trying to do what I do best: because I cant do step overs or any body feints, shoot propely or think reflexively, I do these things: "I fill spaces to avoid passes from the others, (we are even in numbers so it is possible, tactically, for me to do that) if we get overwhelmed, I try to hog the ball OR intercept it until the whole field freezes, I try to pass to where people are not looking... and overall be a bit of a hunk of meat that does not necessarly contribute directly, due to my lack of body prowess and overall skill... but that harasses the other team with pressure oh! And I try my HARDEST not to get past by. Oh! and because I cant absorb the state of the field very fast... I have to run... alot. Ok so these are my skills. We have the following players: A very skilled player about my stature, but obviously way fitter, a very big and strong player who is also clever and can to feints, a player that was by far the best on the field and  I think thats it. The other team has: A very good player, lil git, a very strong girl, and two very physically strong guys that dont really give importance to the overall tactics, though really skilled. The game starts and, honestly, I think I did well... I avoided getting feinted, they had to back pass alot because of me, stole the ball in unconfortable places, did okay passes and I did one very important thing: I was the only guy who did not underestimate lil git. The other guys just kept letting him get past! USE YOUR BODIES! PIN HIM! HES SMALL! YOU GOTTA CONTAIN HIM! sigh... anyways... the game is was going pretty well... but for some reason... I just felt a sort of weird insecurity pour out of me as the game went on and on! I really wanted to leave... I felt the game was about to get shitty for me... I kept doing some mistakes... the others tooo.... but the problem is that they all spoke french... so I did not understand if I was doing well or not! Everytime I did something, they would say stuff but I did not understand it... and I cant recall anyone doing the 'calma!' sign with their hands or a thumbs up or even a open arm thingie saying: 'que foi isso?' Like... am I doing well or not? I kept getting more tense... but mid way through I even scored a goal... but I kept getting more, and more, and more, and more paranoid. Then I asked: "Hey! when is the game over?" They said: "I dunno..." Like what do you mean you dunno? We cant win like that! And I dont wanna play anymore! I was dead serious... I kept saying out loud: "I dont wanna play... I dont wanna play!" But also tried to mask it by doing jokes and uttering: "EEEYAAALLAA!!!!" When someone did a cool feint or something cool happened. I even got challenged physically once but I kept it together and it did not cost us anything... but... My stamina was crap... they kept getting past me with sheer speed... and There was a point that was like: " Thats it im leaving. Bye." and just left! Like... the game just kept going... and I could not take anymore insecurity! And I swear on my life that we only were winning because our team had the best player on the court. We pratically just needed to pass him and he just scored almost automatically! The same for our strong player... OH! And I forgot another kid: he as a bit smalle than me although about the same level of skill as the other guys... But anyways.... I just had to leave! I just wanted... to watch... I wanted it to end... I did not feel at ease at all! No! I dont wanna drill stupid... feints... over and over... I dont wanna... Its just street court football... Why did this happen to me? Like... nothing out of order happened... I promissed, very explicitly that I would play UNTIL someone else stepped in... which was the polite thing to do! But it just kept going... and I kept glancing outside to see if someone was coming... BUT THEY WERE PROBABLY COUNTING AND BECAUSE I WAS PLAYING THEY DID NOT COME! FUCK ME!!!!! Btw... im gonna call the little kid 'Silvio' (not his actual name). I did not want to disappoint silvio... I wanted to play with him as much as possible... ok... but to be fair watching our super player get outdone by Silvio because he was underestimating him then NOT stepping in to show him what can happen was pretty cathardic... That was concretly fun... but the whole game was... and like... they were all nice to me... I just did not wanna play at all! I wanted to just watch... that was the whole point of my walk... But... they were one player short... Bro my Fe was aching so bad...

I was like: "I such... omg... ok Im doing well... what if I do poorly? what if I do poorly? You know? it was my Ti trying to rescue my Fe..."
I hope lil git at least enjoyed the game I allowed to happen

But... just looking around... like... because I was feeling bad, because intuition is intensly tied to emotion I was like: "Ok... all paths lead to misery... anyways who do I pass to?"

No... I was speaking about Ne

Like... Im sorry! Its no one fault... I just like watching more... thats all.

But at least... I didnt completly ruin their game even if my emotions tell me so...

But I DONT KNOW IF I EVEN DID WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL FUCKING FRENCH! GRRRRR!!!!!

But... I dont even think they adressed me? I cant recall... I dont think I understood their body language very well...

Makes me think Im not actually INTP you know? An INTP would not have trouble would they?

BUT WHY DID MY NE NOT DETECT THE VIBE! WHY THEN?

Omg whatever I DID NOT SUCK. Thats a win. Whatever Im gonna fucking play a game now. I touched grass I can rest in peace now.

Oh yeah! Ok... because... I knew when when I had to back off... when to fall back... where I should be... but it was all to feed my Ti... so when I had to act according to my teamates... like receiving feedback... I fell short! Makes sense!

Omg... and I actually had 1 badass moment that trully cemented why I was on that fucking field. I was dribbling the ball, on my way to the goal, and im pure me fashion I missed the shot... not... missing the goal... missing the BALL ENTIRELY! but there was a player right behind me and he got a bloody good shot in after I quickly passed it with no obstruction between us. I was so fucking mad though...

I dont know how to play... I know where to go... thats it ;) Like... bros sometimes were forming... like all of the players on the pitch, a fucking line on the entire left half when the other half had an idle opposing player and then me

But I also tried to block shots alot... but was never sure if I was in front of the keeper or not... he did not complain or say anything...

But like... I like nuanced yapping... not... playing XD

Like... I also played a game in a nearby pitch in a college residence... and they all said I was a very good 'Central'.... I felt so blushy when I said it... they said they were pretty surprised considering my usual behaviour

Oh man... this may have sucked... but I will never stop liking footbal! ever!

But, not gonna lie, although I did not suck... that really good player scored like 8 goals! (the one on our team)

BUT I SCORED! I SCORED 1! And I ALSO GOT A REALLY GOOD SHOT WITH MY NON DOMINANT! IT HIT A DEFENDER BUT IT WAS GOING IN!

ok I know none of this will ever give me a job... but, as long as my body could take it, I would do this every day!

And I even got physically involved with one of their strong players! I distracted him from the ball and he did not shoot, which is important because that guy shooting? its almost a guaranteed goal! We are playing court soccer and our goalie was, reasonably, not bothering enough to  block the 'bujardas' that the strong guy hurls!

I was not planning to get hurt though... but IT DID NOT MATTER BECAUSE HE DID NOT SCORE!
