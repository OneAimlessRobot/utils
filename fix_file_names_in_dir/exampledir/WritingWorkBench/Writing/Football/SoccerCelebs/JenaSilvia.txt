Jena and Silvia Soccer celebrations.

So... one of them scores... the scorer starts running towards the outside line, and the other one notices (they almost always know... feel sad when they dont) and follows..Then both do a knee slide in the direction of a camera, that will end right in front of it, and during it, they post mischiveous grins in their faces and flash both middle fingers.
