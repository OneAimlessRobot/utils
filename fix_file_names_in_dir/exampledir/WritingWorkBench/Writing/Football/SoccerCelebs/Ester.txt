Ok: People asked me: If I played soccer, like Filipa, what would be my goal celebration? I think it would be: "I roll my eyes... wherever I am on the pitch... take off my hair bands... loosen it up... wave it while leaning my head back... feel it... and then put the rubber bands back on... like getting ready for work in the morning then... sigh..."
"When it all seems to get too fluffy... and you call for adulting... "The queen of ego" will pick up the phone"
