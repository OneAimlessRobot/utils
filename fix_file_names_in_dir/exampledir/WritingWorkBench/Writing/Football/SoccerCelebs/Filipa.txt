
Filipa
One for a very cocky girl: "So anyways... I score my shitty tap in right? So then... what Filipa, the queen of earth does is, stamp on the ground with her dominant tree trunk leg, like stomping on an ant, then point down. 'stay down! SHUSH! STAY DOWN' Walk away pointing at that spot. Trot to a camera, blow a kiss do a bit of hip dancing grabbing my own hair, then smile in a cocky way, spelling out "LGHF (let girls have fun, a popular meme on my socials)" On the camera using a very think lip gloss I carry with me just for this specific ocasion."
