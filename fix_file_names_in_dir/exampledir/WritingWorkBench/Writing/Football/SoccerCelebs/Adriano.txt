
So... I score a goal and start running with my arms open in a T. While running, I then 'SHUSH' the audience. Then, I start slowing down while pointing at the ground with both arms spread out. Then I come to a stop, I start throwing my hips repeatetly to one side while pointing my audience along one half of the stadium. then I crouch slowly, to one knee, scrape my hands across the grass. "I am the king of this pitch, as I own each and every single pebble beneath me.". I then throw the grass I grabbed to the air, do the Ulsain bolt thing but with metal hand signs. Then, go back to my position

My football celebration will be me running into the center of the pitch, possibly flipping and waving in a goofy way, centering myself in the 'relvado', checking my legs apart a little bit, hunching my body down, tightning my arms, joining them with curled fists and throwing my arms in the air, like stretching in the morning, but more brashly. all while I have my pampering teamates praising me with gestures  and vows like the theatrical, flashy, overconfident and delicate flower that I f***ing am!


I run at full speed for like a second (just enough for momentum, dont wanna tire myself), Then do a one handed cartwheel into a  back flip, and as soon as I stick the landing, spread my index fingers and arms out while looking at somewhere. Then, I crouch slowly, put a belt into a turret gun made of air, then mock shoot it uncontrolabbly, mock fall accidentally and make a dazed expression. Then shake my head as if unstunning myself, then get up and go to my position.
