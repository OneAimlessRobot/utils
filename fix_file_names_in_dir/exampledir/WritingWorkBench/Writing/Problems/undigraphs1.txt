Certainly! Undirected graphs, also known as undigraphs, are graphs where edges have no directionality. Here are some proof exercises related to undigraphs:

1. Prove that in an undirected graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges.
2. Prove that in an undirected graph, if every vertex has even degree, then the graph has a Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that visits every edge exactly once).
3. Prove that in an undirected graph, if exactly two vertices have odd degree, then the graph has a Eulerian path (a walk that visits every edge exactly once and starts and ends at different vertices).
4. Prove that in an undirected graph, a cut vertex (a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components) cannot belong to any cycle.
5. Prove that in an undirected graph, a bridge (an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components) cannot belong to any cycle.

Feel free to choose any of these to work on, and I'm here to assist you with the proofs!


Definition of an inductive definition for a graph exploration (Perc(urso)):

IG is the set of ALL Undirected Graphs.

V is the set of the datatype "vertex". 

adj: IG Ã— V -> Power(V)

(G,v) = { x E V: Exists e E G.Edges :
e= {v,x}}

Mutual funcs incomming:

Perc: IG x V -> Power(V)
(G,v) = {v} U Exp(G,v) U adj(G,v)

Exp: IG x V -> Power(V)

(G,v)= (
if( #adj(G,v) > 0){
IterativeUnionForAll(x E adj(G,v)){
Perc(G-v,x)

}
else{
{}
}

})



You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the oversight. Let's try a different problem that is simpler and distinct from the handshake lemma. Here's a new problem for you:

**Problem:**
Prove that in any connected undirected graph, there exists at least one vertex with degree at least as large as the square root of the number of vertices in the graph.

This problem involves understanding the relationship between vertex degrees and the size of the graph. It's a fundamental property of connected graphs that can be proved using basic principles of graph theory.

Give it a try, and let me know if you need any hints or guidance along the way!

Simple: V= {1....n}, n>=5
Edges= (x E {1...n-1} => {x, x+1} E Edges)

The exercise is flawed
