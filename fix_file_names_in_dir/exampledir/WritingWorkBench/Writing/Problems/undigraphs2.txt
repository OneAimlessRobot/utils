Certainly! Here's another problem for you:

Prove that in any connected undirected graph with \( n \) vertices and \( m \) edges, where \( n \geq 2 \), there exists at least one pair of vertices with the same degree.

Feel free to tackle this problem, and let me know if you need any hints or guidance!


prove that for any connecte undigraph, if g=<V,E> and  |V|=n,
|E|= n-1+ num of cycles
