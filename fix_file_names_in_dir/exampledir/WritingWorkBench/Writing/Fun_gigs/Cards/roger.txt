Built like a natty greek god on divine juice. Geometrically, his jawline is accurately drawn with a pencil and ruler on a grid piece of paper. Has long hair and only wears tunics from ancient greece. Its not a cosplay. Its his natural attire.
Desc: Very emotional and a dedicated christian. Cries for the weak and competes with the strong. Has a weird rite of passage when meeting people where he asks for a philosophy of life as a first question. If he does not relate, its a hard pass. Wether it be girl, boy, women, man or senior citizen. Anyway... He goes to the gym religiously as he plans to "be able to squat a moutain" before he is dead to "please god". Has a crush on Filipa. Filipa thinks he is weird, but cute. Honest, witty, never sarcastic as sarcasm is "the oxygen of weakness". Can squat over 300kg. Filipa once spoke to him and said, when she was having a bad day...: "what kind of mountain weights 300kg? You must be dreaming if you ever plan on lifting a mountain!" He cried for a month, although still doing normal routine things. Is taking a philosophy course on college and loves to "spread wisdom and positivity". He admires "african people" and tried the food of several rural tribes from there. Unnintentionally racist and offensive. Loves slapstick humor.
