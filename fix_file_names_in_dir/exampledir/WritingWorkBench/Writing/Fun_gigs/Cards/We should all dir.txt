Me and my opinions:

The world is a complete shitshow and a mess. Everything is exploding, everyone is a loser, everyone has a bone to pick, no one needs to feel acountable, no empathy is needed as logic is all you will ever need, our shadows should remain shadows forever. People only recognize the dark side for its manifestations  hate it vaguely and only see what it does. I have no fucks to give, my friends have no fucks to give, everything is just Doom with no violence restrictions. God let the simulation run for far too long and bugs are creeping up like sore skin. Some routines run for so long they now do the opposite. What was internal is now external and what should be external is now internal. People have no restrictions and no accoutability. Everything is worse by the day and people dont even need to lift a finger for it to get any worse. God, please spare us! Just hit "retry". I think everyone should just die. No exceptions. You, me, the lady I just now randomly spotted outside my house just minding its own business, the random guy jogging, the trans woman doing groceries... Everything should be wiped. Galaxies, planets, buildings, populations... everything is built wrong. Just kill it all. Just destroy it all. Quickly. Hit that "Delete world" button on that prop gun of yours, my lord! Everything is a failure. But you are a god. We are nothing. Ive seen everything. Would you mind sending the event to trigger the votemap menu on our clients, our almighty admin? This map sucks. The rich are spawn camping the poor, the matures are sad, the willingfully ignorants are dying inside and the improvers (moderators) feel more powerless every day. Just rid us of all the agony. Please. This cannot be what you want. Please.
