Build: these two sweet street rats are built like the average trouble maker girl that smokes in the boys lockeroom while shes skipping class, but shes cloned! Both wear worn down hoodies, baseball caps under the hood, both have a bored, 'who cares' type look, both walk with their legs spread out like some degens, and Jena has a toothpick she also uses to 'leave the bird cage' to 'touch some grass' followed by Silvia who 'really loves her sister and always has her back', wear way oversized ripped jeans and Silvia has a purple rose tatooed on her neck. Both have a piercing in the nose, multiple in the ears, Slivia has green eyes and Jana has them deep red. Both have rather athletic builds as they are used to running from cops and opps alike. Both have been involved in numerous streetfights having won them frequently because, well, they have the twin coordination of african wild dogs and there was almost always, well, two of them. They figured out how to bring knives to school without triggering the metal sensors. *HEY WHAT ARE YOU WRITING OVER THERE? Jana: "HEY GET YO ASS OVA HIAR WER GOIN SLIT YA THROATHER!"* Hey sup nerds! Im am Jana. Silvia, my comrade over there is holding the idiot writer down so im gonna finish this! Anyways... We are white trash from the trash to the trash through and through baby! We also pick our noses for immune system training! Its science! *pokes temple* Smaaaart! Anyways... I have a huge scare on my left cheek when some p**** n****s tried to jump me with brass knucles! She doesnt. We are not the same.
Desc: So me and Silvia are pretty sweet girls, who get good grades, go to bed on time, dont skip school, dont slit throats from strangers, dont run from the cops, dont drink underaged. Siliva: "HA!!!"... anyways we also love weed! We love to beat the s*** outta nerds but our allies are protected by us with tooth and nail Silvia: *Fist in heart* "For the comrades, by the comrades!". We also pretend to be asleep and then run away through a window at night! Silvia: "OUR PARENTS ARE SOOO DUMB!" RIGHT? Anyways... we are kinda dumb but we always end up being... smart enough... Thats the law of how we choose to live. Silvia: "Yea! How far can you go without touching the fire?"
We are thrill seekers. We also dont detest nerds we just like to beat them up because they are easy. We thank them when they bail us out of being in detention by doing our homework! We are currently in 7th grade. HEY SILVIA! YOU DIRTY B****! PULL YO PANTS! Siliva: "Fine! Dont have to be so mean! jeez..." *pulls pants up half way* Perfect! Silvia: "So classy!" YOU DAMN RIGHT! Ok... this was Jena and Silvia. Youll see more of us so... Silvia: "HEY YOU P***Y A**! STAY STILL WE ARE NOT DONE YET!" Sis just let him go we are done!
Silvia: "Dont ever say mean things about us again"
Me: "BUT YOU ADMITED IT!"
Silvia: "Only Jena can shit talk me!"
Jena: "yeah! Only me! Understand? Oh! And the doctor also said Silvia was an autist!"
Silvia: "HE SAID I WAS ASPERGUS! STOP MIXING IT UP! COME BACK HER JENA!"
Jena: "YO DUMB B****! AUTISTS ARE ASPERGUS! YOU ARE AN AUTIST! STOP BEING DUMB!"
Silvia: "Sorry! BUT YOU A NARCISSIST!"
jena: "But THATS COOLER THAN BEING ASPERGUS! I AM THE BEST! THE DOCTOR SAID SO!"
Silvia: "Youre right... I guess..."
Jena: "Also... our mother beat our asses when we were like 3 so... we ran away when we were 5!"
Silvia: "THAT BASTART!"
Jena: "Its 'Bastard'! Get it together! you gotta stay sharp and smart Silvia!"
Silvia: "Sorry!" *frowns*
*Sergeant! They are here!*
In unissin: "OK WE GOTTA GO BYE!!!!"
