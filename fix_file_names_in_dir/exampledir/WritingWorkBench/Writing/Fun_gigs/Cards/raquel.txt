Raquel
Type: Agro
Age: 20 years (F)
Weight: 75 kg
Height: 180 cm
Thick limbs and core. Never botherer to get rid of bodyfat.
Desc: Work, work and work some more! Dependable, stoic and dad vibes. A guide for Filipa and her murder buddy in the attack against Ester. Practices Jiujitsu. A bit of a tomboy. Fun is a complement of work that is a complement of fun. Very disciplined. Filipa was resentful of her until Tomas opened her eyes. Helped Adriano and the Others when they went after Psych2Go. A crackhead friend of them, Santiago, was like a  voluntary scout. Agros can supercharge their muscles, have naturally super high metabolisms. Their average body temperature is 43 celsius. They produce very high levels of Adrenaline and their muscles grow very fast. Have to eat very often. (A full roasted turkey with salad and potato pur√© will only last them an average of 90 minutes among Agros. Raquel's agro type is more balanced tough. Makes full use of her power as she  voluntarly makes herself the breadwinner of the house. Can run at 100 kmh while piggybacking a 60kg person) Is blunt, but reactive. 
Initially enjoyed Ester's presence. Does not understand art, or the creative process at all, prefering to focus on things that are tied to goals and objectives.
