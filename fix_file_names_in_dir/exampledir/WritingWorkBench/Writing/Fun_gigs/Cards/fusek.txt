Fusek
Type: Mutant Predator
Height: 190cm
Weight:  200kg
Humanoid body. Steel scales cover it all and act as its skin. An strange organ protruding from its back acts as a cannon it can mold and shoot in every direction. Two huge claws in each forearm. Can run at max of 100 kmh, accelerate at 0.5g and with the agility and elegance of the Ronaldinhos and Messis of this world. Can decapitate a Hippopotamus with one running swipe. The average predator body of a predator mutant can only supply one of its plasma cannons with enough calories for it to shoot once per 24 hour period (they have two to three on average, but Fusek has only one). Fusek has a rare ability among its kind: It can turn semi transparent (being very hard to spot at a glance, like one of those glass panels on comedy skits) for 30 seconds with a two hour cooldown. Fusek hunted so mutch it became huge, becoming the leader of the most deadly Mutant Predator pack, The Gra, demolishing other mutant packs in the region inside its territory. It kills its victims in gruesome ways. Its plasma cannon can pierce up to 2 meters of bone. Fusek was spotted surviving encounters with elephants, blue whales (it cant swim) and packs of hyennas. Its armor is 10 cm thick, its heart and cardiovascular system are as hard to cut as humanoid sized wet rugs. Its hair resembles carbon nanotubes and its eyes? Rubies! From which it can see from ultraviolet to infrared. It can run at full speed producing physically unperceptible sound.
Desc: It has no understood personality. Its just seen as a threat to everyone in general. (Like a post apocalyptic Gustav). its name is a nicknamish abreviation for something like :"Metal Meat Mangler" because of the way its known that it...  eats its victims.
