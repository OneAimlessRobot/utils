Desc: Goes to church with her parents and prays everyday. Christian, submissive, greek godess, innocent, meek, inoccent, beautiful, pure, hearted cyberangel. Currently beautymaxxing and suffereing from Hikikomori condition. NAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!! Thats what she may lead you to believe! She goes with her parents because she is 14 and still has the illusion, even with an IQ of 140, that she  needs them to survive, like the innocent kid she is.
She likes them because they make her life convenient. They also shower her with praise after achieving what feels like purely a chore when she gets perfect marks in all her tests. She is Pedro's right hand girl. With her gift for the chemical world, her intellect, rulebook researching prowess and passion for pharmacology, She noticed that Pedro was very keen on surpassing her in grades. But she saw him as an asset she could use to jumpstart her steroid business. she said: "Hey! You look mean! Dont be mean to me! hey! pedro! You see this? *teasingly shakes a small bag filled with a mysterious orange powder* it tastes like orange juice and gives you infinite stamina! Do you want it?" Pedro, flustered: "WHAT? YES! YES! YES! Give me! I HATE GETTING TIRED! IT MAKES ME FEEL SO USELESS! GIVE GIVE! PLEASE GIVE!" *tsk tsk tsk tsk, she vocalises as she waves her left index finger left and right, while holding the bag with two fingers from the other hand* Big boy. I am not 'Pequena' to you, am I? Pedro: "No...." Do you want to keep relying on and carrying 'pequeno's for the rest of your life?
Pedro: "NO!" Then be my lab rat and you wont need those useless people ever again! Pedro: "yes... for sure." beatriz: "I can also teach you meditation. I will keep your mind sharp if the material fails. You will witness as your body succumbs to mysterious symptoms to then rise above the mortal plane. That is... if you dare." Pedro: "Always. I must crush all the 'batatas cozidas' from the enemy. I must reign supreme." beatriz: "See how you are such a clever boy? You must do all that you can before your very own being starts self destructing! You will be an obedient rat, wont you?" Pedro: "Always." After taking that orange powder and waiting for 30 minutes for it to get to the blood, Pedro ran at 22 kph for 1 hour straight at the threadmill. His best was an average of 17." The next day, his body was in unbearable pain for the next 3 weeks.
And... she also has a.... uhhh.... pole... on her crotch. her T levels are so high for self experimentation she started manipulating her parents into not going to a doctor. She does not want them to know...
And What about PE locker rooms, you ask? Simple! She is such a good student she does not need to do PE to get a good grade overall So she just does not do it!

Name: Pedro.
Type: (maybe) Human
Age: 16.
Height: 216cm
Weight: 80kg.
Build: Built like a very boney slenderman. has a very bony face, very big dark circles under eyes, his eye pallette is inverted and is very, very pale. has very, very long limbs and his ribs are clearly visible. Is very athletic, as he constantly crushes David in any kind of sports activity.
Desc: David's Eternal rival. They met in the first year of Highschool. David joined the school's cycling team as his first attempt at connecting with the local community. Pedro is in another HighSchool, which is the fiercest rival of the school David studies at. They met in their first highschool in their HighSchool journeys. During the race, David was clearly the one trying the hardest, which was futile, because he could not keep up with Pedro's sneaky mindgames and just overall superior, yet easly underestimatable physique. Pedro got in David's head and intimidated him. Studied him during the first two stages, closely following behind him, giving the impression to David that he was barely keeping up. When the third stage came, Pedro realized David was "Pequeno" And "batata cozida", So he did what any competitor in that situation does and asserted himself over David. Pedro won that race convincingly, as David was so devastated mentally that he forfeited. Each time Pedro and David met at field trips, Pedro would sneak up behind David and whisper. "Pequeno." "Batata!" "Batata cozida!"  "Bacalhau!" "Azeite!" "Cenoura!" Which are the ingredients for a traditional Portuguese dish using cod (Bacalhau). he was sending him the message he was going to eat him up. Here is an episode between Pedro and his teamate from the Ping-Pong pairs team: "Its training day. Lucio wants to go to Pedro's house. But he is scared of him. So he calls coach to take him there and reassure him. Pedro's house is a shed in the middle of a farmer's property. The shed has a TV That I swear cannot be bigger than a cellphone, a mini fridge connected to a gasoline generator that he gets the money for fuel from doing chores for the farmer and selling meat in the local market. He does not have a bed, he has a leg press, a thread mill, some dumbbells, and thats it. Coach and Lucio ask permission  to the farmer to cross to the Shed. The female farmer says "Sure! But beware. He does not like visitors. *A shiver goes down her spine*" Lucio: "Trust us, M'am. We know."" They go in, aprehensive. They knock on the sheds door, which falls over. They find Pedro hunched over his miniature TV with HORRIBLE Posture (and omg... just buy a phone at that point! Whats the use of such a TV?! Anyway...) Watching replays of the opponents they have to face. There are also very worn down notebooks all over the place. He does everything to keep doing sports. So he has to get good grades. He wants to crush everyone at every dimension. So he is also one of the top scorers in terms of grades. Pedro mutters: "Burn away! Burn away all 'Pequenices'. Burn away! Scrape away! They are 'Pequeno'! They must die! They will die!" Lucio: "Pedro? I.. I... it-- Its... t--t-training day!" Coach and Lucio brace for impact, as Pedro slowly rises up and OMG HE JUST KEEPS GETTING BIGGER WHAT DO THEY FEED THIS KID? As a little bit of a backstory, Pedro has Gigantism, which, among other things, means he will die much earlier than most people. So his lifes mission is to "Crush all 'Pequeno's (small people)" Pedro engages with them in voice. A very eerie thin voice comes out: "Hmmmmm.... teamate! Are you.... 'Pequeno'?" Lucio swallows a bit of saliva and then replies: "N- No?" Pedro replies: "Good. WHERE IS THE CAR?" Coach replies, suddently and in a jumpy way: "HERE! THIS WAY!" Pedro: "Good. We have work to do. These guys dont look like 'Pequeno's. You better get ready to sweat. You too, coach. Im whipping you both into shape" Lucio responds: "D-Dont talk to coach like th-" Coach: "Just do what he says! Shhhhh!!!". They then head to the car and go train in  the schools sports facility." Pedro was diagnosed with limb gigantism at age 5. The doctors said he would not life after 30, and what he would experience just before dying would be terrible. His bones were going to grow erratically, beginning to pierce their way through pedros body, And it would also be random. It could start with a lung, the heard, an appendix. So, at 16 years old, Pedro is determined to "move forward at all costs" And to "crush all 'Pequenos' like 'batata cozida'". He deeply resents the people around him. He considers other people having it  easier than him, specially people of small stature. He has both the personality, attitude and looks of someone you just dont want to approach. His life is "Moving forward" and "crushing 'Pequenos'". Thats it. "I will move forward. Forward, forward, forward. Until I clean house from all 'Pequenos'. My body will grow  faster and faster and faster. And then, I will explode. I just want to... have people to talk to, beyond the constraining barrier of life and death..."
