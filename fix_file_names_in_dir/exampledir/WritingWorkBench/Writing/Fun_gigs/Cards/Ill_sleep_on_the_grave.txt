Adriano is walking along FCT. Classes are over. Adriano has the usual unreasonably hypervigilant, nervous demeanour, with wide open eyes and somewhat creeky walking. Thinking about many things until he relaxes for a moment. He finds a peer. He has messy hair, black clothing and huge dark eye circles. He walks frantically, while steering his head strangely, along with his body, like a car. Walks around doing "zeros". He is... mumbling something. Adriano decides to approach him, as he is from the same class and Adriano wants a little break from all the overthinking. Its Jo√£o. (Adriano/Joao/Adriano/Joao....) "So... are you going home? Classes are over for today... maybe review stuff?" "*gulp!* Ah yes I will do that yes! I will do that.... ok? Bye!" "Hey wait! ahhhgghhh what a f****** dumbass who the fuck asks that fuck me that was so awkward!!!!... sigh... why do I even do this? I cant even talk with my peers about it without putting the fear of god into them..." Ester pulls up "because some people like to separate fun from socializing. You may have scared him, now. He was visibly worried. It would even be more appropriate to ask him if something was wrong than about his fucking college bureocracy management habits. Honestly, you..." "I know... what have I done... now he wont talk to me... he seems like a nice guy too..."
