Approachable appearance. Wears a yellow and black cycling kit.
Desc: Currently 2 time regional mtb race champion. Wins virtually any tournament he enters in. and does it, although struggling, constantly enjoying himself with an open smile on his face. The mud, the oily chains. And studying barely enough to stay on the team. The winding roads. The adversity. The fans. The smells. The wind. Nature. Thats whats constantly on his mind. He enjoys spending time with his other surfer cyclist genius friends having a good laugh, trying crazy tricks and discussing ways to crush the competition in Mountain Bike tournaments. They discuss rivals, make plans and then, at night, play fortnite and call of duty. They go to sleep 10 and wake up at 8. Always with no fail. These surfer friends always keep taps with eachother. Skylar has befriended David after investigating the neets and crevises of the video uploaded by Beatriz, Pedro's unnoficial manager and... enhancement crafter and supplier. Skylar the current year decided to get into the road cycling circuit to track down Pedro and Beatriz. beat them at their own game. Ok some context: Mountain biking is diferent from road cycling. There are no teams. And the courses are much, much, much power intensitive. Because there are no teams, competitors have to be less group reliant and resiliant. They also have to be stronger, as they have to constantly pedal over mud, acelerate quickly on it, maneuver around trees and other obstacles and sometimes even carry their bicicle. or even... God forbid... get their legs dirty. And the bikes are heavier... I think I made my point, right? Skylar demolished the lower ranks in the cycling circuit and even of lots of other top highschool cycling teams. Skylar just cares about 1 thing though: Helping David who is being harassed by Pedro and shutting down Beatriz. But, at the same time, he roams along the world looking for beautiful views, in a constant pursuit for inspiration and connection with himself. Addresses any, person, thing or situation he finds endearing as "petitte", in reference to his first girlfriend who, in the first date, kept refering to as "petitte". To honour her departure to cancer, he does it to keep her memory alive. "I am Skylar. I roam places, I meet new faces, I challenge my opponents for races and win. While I pass the finish line, I look down at the bottom. after going through hell, wether I win or lose, admiring everything nature provides, rejoicing myself in the thrill of post race endorfins. On my way home, I go through winding forest roads, tretched terrain and dodge animals. In my trusty bmc mountain bike, I cut corners, jump guard rails and climb cliffs. All while sweaty, satisfied, happy, aching and enjoying myself and... nature, mesmerized, by the beauty of it all."
