No, you dumbass! You do not need to change sex. Its perfectly fine to not """"""""""act your gender"""""""" ok? Oh so you cant bring yourself to realize that? Well... there are actually working ways to do that, you know. You know! The ones that involve... adressing the issue! You are not gonna change gender because its idiotic, clown, dumb behaviour. Its twice the suffering and you wont ever forget it. Its biologically impossible to do it, you know, without looking and feeling absolutely terrible and being piss poor right after. Im not supporting you. Again, you will never be the same ever again. Many therapists will just tell you: "Just do what you want! Its your body!" The things kids do these days over an introspection incompetence issue... you know? I also thought about changing sex once... I was having a really bad day, felt like nothing was worth it, even felt like ending it. I thought that was a chance to start over. But after considering it for 5 more seconds, I decided not to do it, because it is a terrible, incompetent idea. Its impossible to ever look like whatever you are expecting to look like. I did not need a therapist for that by the way. uhhhh Oh! 1 hour! Thats it for today but before you leave.... if you really want to complete the tailbone of some other chick, just get a strapon, ok?

Then the patient thinks to herself as she walks off: "You know... that actually sounds... hot? The desperate girl who wants to dominate so she gets a strappon... Girls might actually think thats sexy..."
