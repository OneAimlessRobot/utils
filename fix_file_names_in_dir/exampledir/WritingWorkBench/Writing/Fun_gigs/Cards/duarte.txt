Desc: Intuitive type. Does not apear as the thinking type, but feels way more than speaks. Considers philosofy a waste of energy. Likes spilling energy everywhere. Party goer, but not indulger. Rugby federate. Parents wanted him to be a doctor. Considers life simple, even for sad people. "The answer is right in your hands.". One of Sofia's soul nurses.
Kind of a jock, but also not a toxic one. Wishes everyone would just "get him". "Nerds are cool people, jocks are cool people. I like sports and parties, he likes computers, she likes movies and theater stuff... He thinks watching porn is the only thing he needs to fully contain the cruel waves of reality life incessantly tries to knock him down with. Hes not a degenerate. He is just stubburn. She hates men. She is lonely. Our world has prejudice everywhere. Everywhere. Whoever does not believe me, wasted their life asking the wrong questions. People are also capable of discipline, planning and helping each other. But it feels so hard to validate ourselves. Humanity hates itself. Its like everything is our fault  we are dumb, we are narcissists... No wonder... if we want it to be true so bad. Lifes simple. Just accept it."
