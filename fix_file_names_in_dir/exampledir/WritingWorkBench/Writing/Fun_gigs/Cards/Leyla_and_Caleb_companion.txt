Leyla and Caleb companion Idea


I would like to make something gaming related with them as a central topic. Like a dll you inject into a game. It would be like OpenGL, where it is a concept but not an implementation. You inject the dll and, it could do more, but it would open a console and if you, like, die alot, caleb would (this is all in text btw) throw a fit and Leyla would tell him Leyla things. But if you always walked the same routes and did the same things Leyla would complain about being bored and wanting to go to bed and Caleb would do Caleb things. It does not even need to be a dll but I want it to work with every game, though
