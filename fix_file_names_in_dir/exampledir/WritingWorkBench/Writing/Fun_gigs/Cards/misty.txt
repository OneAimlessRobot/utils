Misty
Type: GMH
Age: 15 (F)
Height: 165cm
Weight: 90kg
Built thin with artificial bones and muscles. Muscular. Can run at 70 mph. Can create plasma blasts. Can sit perfectly still for months when feeling like it, waiting for a target.
Desc: Genetically modified bratty sharpshooter created by the lab that also spawned Psych2Go in order to right their wrongs. (By spawning another freak). Although she is GMH, she was worked on with sanity and decency into consideration. Raised as a spoiled brat (she was made in a lab). She is playful, difficult, unrully. Often banters in her intercom with her co-workers who are just trying to get business done on tight deadlines. Got a few shots on target, during the fight, where Raquel, Adriano, Filipa and Ester and some others joined forces to take down the thing that raptured a dear friend of Adriano, Diana, which was futile, as Psych2Go only has 1 very tiny weakspot. "Daddy somehow thinks bullets solve everything... So american and dumb... My dad is such a bum..." ( Jacinto and Ruben were introduced during this time by a trip to Torres Vedras by Ester.) She is caotic and navigates the battlefield like a 10 year old playing GTA V free roam. She enjoys it too.
She Carries a Denel NTW-20, a knife and a berreta 9mm and can also carry over 50kg of other things and still run at full speed.
