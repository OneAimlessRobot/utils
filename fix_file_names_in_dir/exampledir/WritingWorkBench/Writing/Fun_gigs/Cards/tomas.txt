Tomas
Type: Human
Age: 21 years (M)
Weight: 60 kg
Height: 170 cm
Build: Tomas is a very fit and toned college student. His skin is somewhat pale, has black, retinaless eyes, an almost permanently well rested expression in his face, Tranquil eyebrows, clear skin. Also, tidy black hair and somewhat big eyes. His lips are faintly colored. has a small birth spot on his left cheek. he wears either, very colorful, or very discrete Tshirts or sweaters, shorts or jeans and does not wear any kind of acessory or jewlery. His body looks thin, as he is currently a (very sucessful) college level cyclist. Currently, a climber for the torres vedras college level road cycling team. Trains mountain biking and running in coarse sand to toughen up, as he hates gyms ("they are complicated, cramped, sweaty prisons full of skin diseases". he says that every time someone mentions gyms). His jaw is somewhat defined. His ribs are visible, yet has a very visible 6 pack. His walking is slow, deliberate and self assured, with a bit of lazyness throwin in and also exudence of zen energy.
Desc: Tomas is all about peace and inner balance. He follows very specific routines and is working towards "Absolute zen". Is also an ambitious cyclist and plans to compete all over the world to "Merge with the worlds roads, winds and forests". Enjoys nature. Hates cities. Enjoys 'a feira'. Hates malls with a fervant passion. His ability to keep his emotions in a constant state of balance and to deploy the required agressiveness when demaded to or when he sees as necessary is remarkable. People generally have like Annoyed, angry and VERY ANGRY. Tomas has, 5%, 10%, 15%... etc. WITH ALL EMOTIONS! Also very smart and has a penchant for thinking outside the box. Looks like he is both half asleep and more focused than anyone around.
But... he had... 1 insecurity. YES! TOMAS WAS ALSO INSECURE BEFORE! He thought... he was not as strong as his peers during middle school... "Look at them... I bet they can knock down that locker if they want too... I wanna try to seem like I absolutely adore myself... BUT I JUST CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE! I WANNA BE STRONG! I WANNA! *sobs*" He thought he was "unreliable", "Slow", and even... (He was a teenager so dont worry about his current mental state) "Physically deformed in the muscles". But then... he found the middle school cycling team. As he became a climber, during training, just so his coach could help him basically 'zerar' the emotional sidequest, (He also had similar levels of maturity for other things to those of today. he looked like he was ready to find his inner purpose. the GIT WAS 14!!!!!) tried to train him to resist the teasing from his mates, to throw him off balance. They called him simple things like "Weak", "'fracote'", etc. he got rilled up every time. But his coach taught him: "EÉs um metronomo meu filho! Nao um martelo pneumatico! A consistencia do teu ritmo ladeiras acima nao tem rival! parece que nem desaceleras mesmo quando a inclinaçao duplica! Tu voas onde outros rastejam. Mas... isso e... se estiveres em harmonia. Portanto... o teu desafio, nao e aprenderes a veres-te como forte para acalmar o teu ego. O teu objetivo e maximizar a tua harmonia. Se fizeres isso, o resto encaixa logo no sitio." When he finally listened to his coach, he started ignoring the teasing so... then... he just kept winning! Tomas is true viber goat, an inner peace grand master, a ethereal wisdom mvp. A true... son of christ. This was the boy... that synthia raised. Tomas frequently interacts with Filipa, Adriano, Ester and Raquel. Tomas is an accountability partner for Ester, a mentor for Adriano, Filipas crush and Raquel's leading right hand man. Tomas helps keep Ester's demons in check, to validate Filipa, guide Adriano and to loosen up the burden of Raquel. More of a jack of all trades supporter than a specialized performer. he is the tuning fork, not the singer. The wrench, not the engine. A harmony beacon that works behind the scenes, self assured, reflective and, when asked to, Commanding respect and attention. The true definition of "The super man". He is like one of those kid twins from Demon slayer, except he is portuguese, a college cyclist enrolled in mechanical engineering in IST (Instituto Superior  Tecnico) and there is only one of them. One... Tomas. Definition of silk touch, but ravaging power.
Something his current coach noticed while watching him in a race is that, whenever tomas speeds up, its as if the air itself 'simply lets him by'. Tomas claims to be untypable, like Reika, because "my mbti is not relevant when... You just... exist at peace... with every corner of your being. I think I am... All the types"


Example interaction:
*Tomas and his team are lined up for another stage in the national, college level Portuguese Cycling Tour. We are in Torres Vedras, Tomas's hometown. Its sunny, dry and its hard to breathe. Both teams are exausted, as it is the last day. Tomas is no exception. As Tomas looks at the clouds in his own head, a rival competitor teases him in a rather... unwelcome fashion:* 
"Hey dude! Look at those clouds! Your mom wishes she was riding one" (Tomas's mom has GAD) Tomas: "*Deep breath*.....* A few seconds later, with a nonchalant, calm and slow tone, but filled with intent* You will swallow those words along with your pride, as I wipe your broken ego off the track when I pass you by"

Flavour text:

"When Im up a hill and the wheels meld into the road, like trainwheels on a track, and feel myself lift off as the air pulls me upward and my teamates behind my back thrust their sweat and blood tears and hope upon me, giving me the fuel to win at the summit, my body, my soul, my mind, the road I ride on and the air that cuts through my kit all become one, single, undefeatable monster"

I also enjoy social media. You know that meme of the chair and all the rain? The chair is me.
