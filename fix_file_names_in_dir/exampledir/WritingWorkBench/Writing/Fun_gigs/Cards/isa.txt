Isa:
Type: Human
Age: 20 (F)
Weight: 59kg
Height: 168cm
Build: Attractive body, exercises regularly, makes sure to not build as much visible muscle as possible, does mostly... just squats. wears typical rich girl clothing, wears pants that funnel bottom up. Has a worn down face, very much so for a 19 year old girl. 
Has noticeable dark under eyes and always a cocky, confident smile that says: "If you dont stay down, ill make sure of it!"
Desc: Is enrolled in the same school as Ester. Is her self proclaimed best friend.  gets over with teachers to get better grades. Enjoys showing off jewelry that she buys from the high end job she got even before college. Enjoys praising colleagues to "build networking, sis!" Considers, as a biomedical engineer, art "for clowns" and music "for depressed emos" and psychology "lazy people lies". Considers people with dyed hair "Goth freaks" and people who simply wear black frequently "Depressed emos". Had an abusive mother and zero father, Her mother, who Isa admired and who enjoyed living with as she "was so wise and smart", until, at 13, when she got left alone in the huge mansion she grew up in and got setenced to fending off for herself, even having to provide for the mother who would ask her for money monthly. She always represses her own emotions at daytime, as she does not even allow herself to throw the usual fits narcissists throw because it would "ruin my reputation, babe!". "I gaslit a child into believing they are gay. Then gave them the 10 required steps to start hating themselves." "I made them learn how to make their intuitions be quiet forever because they were denying my wisdom at the moment!". One day, she was in bed, the usual constant mental battle to not hurt herself, as she battles being lonely, narcissistic, having no real friends or any real emotional support besides shallow praise from the complete strangers she has as co workers and friends, feeling like "hmmm... is human skin tasty? way better than... shut up! your beauty sleep isng over yet sis! gotta slay 24/7 all day sis! 27/4 in a week, 356 hours a day, 24 hours a year,.as she right now cries with loud whaling and painful screaming that she cant even hear herself produce over the pure, raw, stinging, full body psycho somatic pain. She once spread a disease the lab she worked on was experimenting with at the time  that was suposed to be sold to the saudi government as a torturing device, in the campus she studies at , because "a fatty I hate got away with it!"  what, you ask? "She did not greet me this morning, and then she got a better grade than me!!!! AND SHE IS AN ANIME ENJOYING GOTH FREAK! EW!". At night, all she can see is herself surrounded by millions of insects. In the day, her enemy set is converted to the complementary of herself. the colours invert as the pain drowns her thoughts, emotions. Ester is the only one that gets her , even if Isa is not aware of it.

Persona.
Name: Isa. 170cm, 59 kg, 19 years (F). A diagnosed NPD and HPD. She has big breasts, naga skin coloring, an attitude problem and a big void, not in character development, but in connection. If she had 1 person. 1 person... her mom, who left her alone, at 13, in a huge mansion. Isa had to find a job with her... luckly gifted in resourcefulness. After a near death experience due to an overdose she justified as "grinding for slay queen status yas", where she bunched herself full of all kinds of drugs to "slay harder", in order to prove others wrong about her character . Self destroying ball of misery and horrendously misguided validation seeking. A silly girl at her core. Barren wasteland. Now... beyond too real. 

*Author notes*

One thing that clearly stands out if youve had more than 1 or 2 encounters with Isa is: she... CLEARLY... Hates emos.

I think I can already explain that, 1 year after coming up with the character: There is this concept in Jungian psychology called the Cognitive orientation. Introversion/Extroversion. Introversion refers to inner contemplation and organization. Extroversion refers to gathering of info and conforming to/acting upon the world. There is also this concept in graphical processing that is a framebuffer. The frame buffer is a constant and changes from aplication to aplication and is software enforced. So the graphical processing unit has to do 2 things: gather frames into the frame buffer, and process them as they come. It has to do both in a balanced and even manner for the game to run smoothly. It has to generate frames just as fast as it processes them. If the gpu finds itself running out of frame buffer space too slowly, the game will run slow. And if it runs out of framebuffer too fast it will... also... run slow. Its the same thing with people and their cognition: if they gather information and explore and experience too much at once, it will just overwhelm them and they wont be engaged at all, and no new intelligence will be constructed. Yet... if they find themselves underwhelmed and with too little to do, they will start bogging and bittering down because of their futile contemplation and excessive self loathing/pity/grooming. Now... going back to Isa, Isa, although she could never quite grasp it consciously, even now during her redemption phase, views emos as the way too contemplative part. The reason she hates emos then, is not because they simply are emos, its because Isa has always had this lingering and pungent feeling that people will never ever try to understand her. In her mind, the world is forcing her to accept that she is a bad person through and through and that it will never change no matter what she does. Ignorance. Isa... loathes ignorance. She thinks emos are ignorant. Always in their head, always reflecting, always doing stuff that isnt productive or that matters. But then... Isa is also ignorant in her own right, as she dives too much into the big frame buffer spectrum, as, because she cant stand experiencing too much at once, she then adults too much at once, acting upon the world in often shallow, destructive, misguided and excessive, unecessary ways, becoming just as ignorant as she thinks emos are. At least emos... dont actively seek destruction like Isa does... right?


Then, the frustration comes from when all she does is "slay", and adult and achieve and dominate the weak but... her life , at some point... just stopped moving. Her inner world... stopped evolving and is now rotting into nothing. Thats Isas true tragedy.

She is basically how I imagined teenagers were as a kid.
