Lucia
Type: GMH (Genetically Modified Human).
Age: 26 (F)
Weight: 90kg
Height: 180cm
Has steel bones. Every cartoonish idea the average 12 year old has ever thought to implement in own body was experimented one her. Has 6 extra organs ( including one stomach, two Psychic Genrators in the head and artificial muscles in one of the legs.)
Desc: Tragic, unjust, cruel... she was a punching bag all her life. First abused by a sociopathic boyfriend for 9 years. Then... Psych2Go came knocking. She was """""Rescued""""" without him seeing (to gain her trust). Came back after 3 months of many, many agonizing experiments and surgeries. She was then motivated to brutally murder her boyfriend. Got help from Psych2Go to clear the evidence. Catharsis was the flavour of her relationship with Psych2Go. Quickly regretted this non decision as she started to be abused by her Master and forced to do obscene things to people. Killed many. Then... one experiment was suposed to make her the crown jewel of Psych2Go's fleet of freaks. The experiment went well (Well... not for Lucia, as she had 100 of her bones replaced, with no concept of hygiene or pain supressants, one of her eyes bursted as the Psychic apparatus got swollen to a point it took too mutch space. She ended up still atractive somehow and thats because Psych2Go enjoyed... watching her... And, in the same surgery, that eye got replaced by an artificial one. She decided to assault Psych2Go and succeeded. 
Is currently learning the meaning of life without regrets or a master with her buddy, Martim. "I might just put you out of your misery if it turns out impossible, do you understand? But either way, you would still be my best ever friend."
