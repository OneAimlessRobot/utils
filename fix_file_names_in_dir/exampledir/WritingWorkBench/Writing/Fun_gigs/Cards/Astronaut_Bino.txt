Hello! Im making a character based on a person and want to make it like some sort of playing card description: Like: name... whatever... (continues) weight... bla bla bla; height... bla bla bla. And need the real dimensions.
There is this guy I really admire and he is 208 cm. This is what he looks like (image)


Ok: He has very dark skin, he is very muscular... but the thing is... I dont know fat percentages. Hes also not HUGE... hes just kinda toned, but even then very, very thoroughly shredded. He seems to have fast twitch muscles... but trying to guess it just from how he looks is an absolute pipe dream... I dont think I can describe him without the picture...

I know what I am doing. But... wow... I mean... he is pretty humble and humurous for an exercise content creator... Honestly... I doubt he is even serious... the mask he wants to portray in his content is someone who just cares about improving and then having gorgeous looking dishes at the end... And he does pretty goofy and out of pocket things... (Like eating 19 hot dogs at the end of one of his workouts). Someone called him "glazing gladiator" and he hearted the comment
