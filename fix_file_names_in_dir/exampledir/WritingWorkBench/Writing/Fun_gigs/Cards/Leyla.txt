I see a nee character. Her name is Leyla. Leyla spends her days watching movies and goofing around with friends in parties. She attends college. She gets good to mid graded and is a very pragmatic and intelligent person. She is friends with Caleb. Leyla enjoys videogames, that she plays with Caleb. Caleb, well, sucks at them. But  Leyla learns quickly and always somehow excells. Her playstyle, in life, sports, games, everything, is one of strategy, elusiveness, sprinkled with deceit and raw intellectual hunger. She has a twisted curiosity to her, that makes her dangerous. Her teachers are afraid of making it too easy for her, as her cynical demeanour demands so much respect. She likes omlets. She plays alot of HvH in Valve games, OSU!, Ranked chess and is a CS undergrad student. She enjoys drinking, joking about the tests she  and her friends undertook and how  "my friend is so damn dumb". She says making cheats undetectible by valve is comparable to ranking in chess up after a whole semester in college. She has an active love life, although she struggles with commitment. She isnt very playful. She is not evil either. She is also not a ninja, or a cynical doomer. She is... Leyla.
