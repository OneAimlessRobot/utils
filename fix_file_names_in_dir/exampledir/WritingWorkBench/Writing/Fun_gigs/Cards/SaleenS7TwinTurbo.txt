Name: Saleen S7 Twin Turbo.
Type: (Very emotionally honest) Automobile. A Car. Thats it.
Age: f(currDate, purchaseDate) = currDate-purchaseDate
Build: This american car features a wide and long body, space frame chassis, made of steel and aluminum for reinforcement. Single seater. The tires are large for extra mechanical grip. Has an MR layout, (mid engine and rear wheel drive). Models are projected to weight around 1.3 Metric tons. Features power steering. The engine of the car is a 7.0L V8 layout that got a Twin Turbo forced induction system by Garret strapped to it, making it produce up to 750hp with the help of 5.5 psi of boost. I decided for all of them to come with the Huge Wing from the LM version. The headlights are large, expressive, with a shape asserting its exotic style. the windshield is big and the cockpit is very small relative to the rest of the car and the car is very low to the ground. Silvery white, metalic paint. It has no driver aids and is a total menace to try and tame. The cockpit is barebones and efficient, emphasising its performance oriented design. It can be considered an exotic, sports car, super car and coupe. Has a 6 speed manual transmission. Butterfly doors.

*manual flavour text* 'A deafening roar of a metalic, road going, demon is heard... The tarmac ravaged into submission by a mechanical hellspawn.'

"I may be a rust bucket, I may be an ass to handle on the road, I may not even need this much power... specially this much turbocharging, I may look like I was designed by a 12 year old, I may be too big for 90% of garages, I may be tacky, I may be loud and a hassle to maintain and use... I may be a loner rich mans car (quite fitting of my stupid, emotional, obnoxious personality I think...)...I may have my stupid engine in the place of luggage space... but hey!... at least Im fast!...."

Its made of carbon fiber soo its all textury and I love the slight friction of being touched there! I like it! can anyone please buy me? Tell me jokes? Push me around the neighbourhood?
