What do people in the residence where I live at even do all day? Oh yeah.... they work, they may meditate, they may exercise, they may chat with their families over the phone, they may not even be in their rooms all day (shocked)! The possibilities are endless... I really want to talk to people right now and just V I B E... Or maybe I should just practise a hobby or smth. Im already doing it Im writting :P. This place is lonely as hell... The people that study in a college that is right next door just come here for the study room at the entrance and dont really talk to anyone... (and also the snack bar that is built into the residence in the ground floor). I read a post on reddit that said that a human needs 4 hugs a day for bare minimum survivability and that makes me severely worried! I am so entrenched in ironic self deprecation and unhinged, overly abstract reasoning that I genuenly think that all gonads do to people is give them base stats :P I am also completly all consumed by cynnicism and cringe if the humor shows that I watch dont make me laugh hysterically everytime (I just dont laugh because they are made for low class, basic people unlike myself). Although I am still a college student and technically still a nobody, if I enter a pharmacy, a supermarket or a library or anything, I will of course be polite and maybe even crack a few jokes, but deep down I still believe that I am better than you by design and I even had to use that mindset to even get confident enough to leave my house! If I was not this arrogant I would already have given up on everything!
