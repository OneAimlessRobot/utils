Yakui is one of the most popular maids. Her name comes from "Yakuji" ("Medicine"), also comes from “Yaku”（“calamity”）.

Appearance

Yakui has bob-cut purple hair, and her maid outfit is usually blue, or purple. She is usually drooling in art, or has a crazed look in her eye. She is sometimes shown wearing handcuffs. The pills she takes stunted her growth, leading to her being quite short.

Personality

Yakui is addicted to pharmaceuticals. She's known to give out medicinal advice to passersby in drug stores, but whether this advice is good or not is up for speculation. At critical moments, she can see what is invisible to others and hear what others can't hear. She's very capable without her medication, but a slight overdose would make her useless. The handcuffs are meant to force her to cut down on her medication every month to behave. She can simultaneously hallucinate others, and keep herself in a trance for long periods of time, which is dangerous. However，when it comes to changing people's hearts with medication, she always draws the line and guards it.
