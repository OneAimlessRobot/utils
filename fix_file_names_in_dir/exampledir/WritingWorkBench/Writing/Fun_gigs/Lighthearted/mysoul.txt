It would definitely be:

void* get_soul(Freakthing* myself){

If(!isDisgusting(myself)){

perror("Dreaming that mutch is unhealthy");

Freakthing*mefromthisnightmare=myself;
//redundant. remove later if(isDeadInside( myself)){}

free(myself->gripofshame);
free(myself->gripofreality);
free(mefromthisnightmare);

fprintf(stdout,"Goodnight pointlessness");
exit(-1);

}

myself->excusetosuffer= "I must become what I love so I feel like I did not live in vain\n";

return (void *)myself;


}
