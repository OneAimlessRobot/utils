I live in a student residence where an elevator is being rebuilt. I allways wake up at 9 am to the sound of grinders and worker to worker communication. It feels rough on the years, but conforting at the same time. The world around me is slowly getting better. They are dedicated, they are skillful and they care. Their communication shouting echoes with their sweat and their effort. One day it will be ready, one day. I allways like it when workers outside the building scream at the ones inside the building and inside the elevator. The fact that even works may show that the insulation is bad for the cynical. But you can look at it in another way. For us, the building is where you go to speak to the people inside it. Thats... just what the law of intuition and common sense tell us. They work on this building. They know its properties inside and out. They are awesome. I allways greet them in the morning.
