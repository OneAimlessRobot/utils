So I am walking on the street heading home and back from doing groceries (I had bought 1 lidl soup, another lidl soup and another lidl soup and some toothpaste). I am wearing a maid outfit. It is blue, black and yellow. Really vibrant and deep yellow and blue too. Blud can be seen clearly from miles away by a myopic gamer! Anyways... It had just stopped raining and the street was full of puddles! I really liked my clothing and some shitnerd highschoolers (Im 23) started mocking me!!!! Losers... they will never understand the true epic main character shit I do out of sheer brilliance and wit. Anyways I had to really avoid these puddles otherwise I was gonna get a cold! Why is there SOOO MANY PUDDLES!!!! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGSSHSGSHANUW RFGNSABGAAUAVSKDSNAKJS!!!!!1!!1!1!1!1!1!1!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!1!1!!! So I just had to jump around them very, very carefully so my kickass maid outfit would not get wet. I was also using chonky ass military boots so I could step on em puddles with full force and subdue them in case I just felt angry on my way home! (DIE WET SCUM!!!!!!). Then... I passed by a muslim temple thingy (I dont know the correct term plsss dont call me scary names >( ) and saw a woman in a burka. I raised my hand while doing the heavy metal hand sign thing and smiling at her. She then formed a tube with her hands and screamed: "MAY ALLAH BE WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!! GO KICK ASS!!!!!!!"  Anyways... then I just put on some music and vibed on the rest of the way home.
