Leyla moment with caleb:

*Caleb and leyla are on their way to the beach. Leyla decides stop at a cafe. Caleb follows her but he is stopped short by Leyla*

Leyla: Stay here.
Caleb: Nah why? lets go together! 
Leyla: I just wanna go to the bathroom and then we will go on our way. Wait here, k?
*Leyla just goes in... walking intentionally, yet calmly to the cafes WC. A couple minutes later, a flush is heard and the sink tap flowing too. Leyla walks out and returns to Caleb*
Caleb: Leyla? Wasnt that a bit weird and impolite? You did not even ask for anything... why not at least a glass of water or smth?
Leyla: The beach is still far and we decided going on foot, didnt we? Its 4k away. If I ate anything, I would have to piss in the grass half way there. It would defeat the purpose. My water diff would not change. And its not their fault I dont need their food... *shrugs shoulders*
Caleb: But... not even greeting them?
Leyla: I was a good girl, ok? I flushed, washed my hands, covered the toilet seat and turned off the lights on my way out... but I think you are kinda right... not even greeting them was a bit awkward.
*smiles sheepishly*
