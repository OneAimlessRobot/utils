I am self destructing. I wonder... what does it all mean? My anguish knows no bounds. I am restless and I am hopeless. Every minute of this day I wallowed in unfulfilled hopes and dreams. I bashed myself then swalled tears. I blamed myself, my mother, my old highschool peers, a girl just across the street and then myself again. This sadness, this chaos, all the innadequacy, its violent, its fast, my chest burns, I am angry and I am powerless. I am a pathetic martyr that does never chose action. I grip my chest with both arms in a cross while on my knees and fruitlessly yelling to any gods: " IM SORRY!!!! I AM WORTHLESS!!!! I WASTED EVERYTHING YOU GAVE ME!!!! I BETRAYED YOU, MY PEERS AND REMAINING FELLOW MEN, MY FAMILY, MY SOUL AND EVEN MYSELF!!!! I CANT EVEN IMAGINE QUANTIFYING MY SUFFERING!!!!

I DONT NEED NICETIES LIKE VOLUNTEERING OR REPRESENTING WHATEVER TO BE  A GREAT MAN LIKE ALL OF YOU! I JUST NEED AND DESPERATELY CRAVE CONNECTION AND TEARS! SOMETHING FAMILIAR TO WARM MYSELF AT NIGHT!

I JUST NEED THE CONCRETE TO STAY ALIVE! VAGUE FANTASIES JUST CHOKE ME! I WILL FOREVER AND ALLWAYS FORGIVE MYSELF FOR ALL MY FAULTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND WILL EVER HAPPEN! I AM FREE! I AM... Adriano. And I am... wounded. NO... Not wounded. Just... incomplete. My family was very loving! I never got hurt! To claim that I am hurt would be like claiming that I am crippled from birth! I wont disrespect my family like that. I will seek help through any means necessary. But I will allways acknowledge this phase as incompleteness. No one ever crippled me! I WILL REMIND MYSELF OF THIS CLARITY UNTILI DIE! I AM NOT WOUNDED! I forgave my family long ago. I cant devalue them. They ALLWAYS gave me EVERYTHING I EVER NEEDED! I... just need to learn. And wait for my egg of colour to hatch. As the clearing skies finally let the sun rain on me, I finally recognize my deepest desire: to become a great man. I can do it. I must believe in it and any other thoughts are secondary! I will do it for my strong brother, my kind mother and even... for my demanding grandmother. I will be the nest of all the deceased ones in my family! Im tired of asking for warmth! I WILL BE THE WARMTH! THIS IS MY BANE AND MY PARADISE! HELL AND HEAVEN! MY EXISTENCE! I WILL... PRESERVE! I WILL... PROTECT! I WILL PURIFY! I MAY NOT BE STRONG OR KIND! BUT AFTER I BECOME PURE I WILL FIND OUT WHAT I AM TRULLY MEANT TO BE... and it is just beyond the horizon. My mission is to taste... I will carry all of them to victory! I allways just thought that being strong and smart and charming was enough... I am just so incredibly small... and I am happy for that. Ive got such a long way to go. I am nothing compared to the likes of Augusto Cury... or that little Jordan guy. It sounds absurd and obvious to say this. Its just to really hammer in the absurdity of my personality. I am just a college kid who can barely think abstractly sometimes and wastes all that he has to escape himself. I guess i am in need a bit of a headshake... I am no genius and I am no historical figure. But I have potential. I will grow ten times as big. No. fifty. But I will still be small. That is the true value in seeing yourself as small. It isnt that you are powerless. You just have soo much room to become powerful, that it is a waste to ve powerless. I am finally at peace. As long as I remind myself of this everyday, I will win.
