Filipa and Adriano are having a fucking seizure at 4pm in the middle of a stroll from a trip to the grocery store. Then Filipa remembers that she has autism and not epilepsy and her seizure stops Adriano stops acting up and finally embraces his dysphoria. And stops seizuring all over the place like a demented walrus! And seizure stops! Adriano then says: "WHAT... WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE???!!!! ITS SCARY I WANNA GO HOME TO MY MOMMY!!!!! I MISS SOFIA AND ANA AND TIPO!!!!!!! AND MARTA AND BEATRIZ!!!!" Filipa forgets that she is autistic and responds with incredible brashness and wit: "BE QUIET! IF THEY ARE GONE, ITS EITHER FOR THE BEST OR ITS SIMPLY YOUR FAULT!" "DONT SAY THAT THATS MEAN!!!! AND WHY ARE WE SHOUTING???!!!!" " YOU STARTED!!!!" "WHY DID YOU SHOUT AFTER ME! IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!!!! LOOK AT ME! YOU MADE ME AGITATED I HOPE YOU ARE DONE AND SORRY!" "I WAS SHOUTING TO MAKE YOU MORE ATTENTIVE TO ME!!!" "THATS NOT HOW YOU USE THAT WORD!!!!!!" "YES IT IS!!!" Adriano gets struck by a wave of cold shivers. He isnt even worried or truly scared. Just... trying not to be swallowed by the monster trying to consume him. "I miss my friends... I wanna hug Diana and do a cool handshake with guilherme... Lonelyness really is the deadliest venom... But ALL I HAVE IS UNFULFILLED DREAMS I WONT LET THAT KEEP ME DOWN AND DUMB! ILL LET DYSPHORIA BE MY FUEL! LETS DANCE LIKE MONKEYS!" "YEAH!" Then they dance like monkeys, while still outside, for 10 minutes and 24 seconds straight. Its now 16:10'24" in the evening. The day has 48 hours of daylight for 56 hours straight at this time of the year! So lets party! (In conjunction) "YEAH!!!!" *Astrofish by Naite the maid starts playing* "Lets go to an astrology specialist to know our future! Adriano AREEEEE YOOOUUUU WITTTHHHH MEEEEEE?????!!!!!!" "YYYYEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!" *Main character shit immediatly ensues. Adriano starts head banging against the air with violence and filipa spastically skips in place to the sounds of indie maidcore in the middle of the street (with extra power of friendship plot armor)* They get tired of making fools of themselves
