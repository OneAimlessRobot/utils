We are in lourinhã. Ester is on her way back to college after another visit to Adrianos house where filipa was. Filipa had just laughted at Esters plea for acceptance, once again. "Out of here, you skunk! I will never ever respect you! You are just a shallow disney princess! rat! A shark! A vacumm! Nothing!" Ester planned for it. Even though she is training her spirit very hard everyday so she can think somewhat less and feel a bit more, to be like filipa, as her guide, Deolinda, suggested as her path to victory, her extreme resourcefulness is still on full display, as she counted and calculated, virtually by hand, all the calories, all the psychic powered flight stops and trajectories she would take on her way back. If she was accepted, she was expecting rejection so hard, that all her calculations would fall short in case of success... Anyway, she then turns around and walks at exactly 3 kph non stop until she reaches the Novo banco ATM. She lines up and flies to a very specific manhole near a bar, on the highest point of a descending street that leads to the bus station (where she would eat and sleep), as it is midnight and there is no one outside to see it. She knew she was stuck in lourinhã for the night. she gets to the manhole. She lines up again. Suddently, she feels a presence. Its stenches and it is wicked and twisted! Alive, but somehow so cruel! Its cold! And purely mechanical! Its psych2go! (First to talk is psych2go) "Sooo!!!!... Its you again!!!!!!. Missed me after I packed you up and left you to the fishes???!!!!" *Goofy music starts playing, as Ester looks absolutely unbothered... bored... even underwhelmed* "Look..
 can we like... part ways or something? I was in the middle of something... uhhh... can you like... get of the way? I dont really want to talk to strangers now... and you ruined me hair last time we met, you know that?" "WHO CARES ABOUT HAIR???!!!!! I AM BACK IN BUSINESS! AND LOOK WHO IS WITH ME!"   (Lucia appears behind psych2go, just tall enough to cover her) "Really? Bih you sure are flaky.... how did that pile of white gunk and sewer pudding end up enlisting you to their army of losers this time?" "JOIN ME! WE WILL RULE THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND WE WILL LOOK DOWN ON THOSE WHO DEFY THOSE WHO WANT EMPATHY! AND COMPASSION! FILIPA WILL GET WHAT SHE DESERVES!" "Leave filipa out of this! She has nothing to to with you! You remind me of myself! *spit!* I think I am sick now! Now... OUT OF MY WAY!JUST TAKE OVER THE WORLD IF YOU REALLY WANT IT THAT MUCH! I DONT ACTUALLY CARE YOU SEE?! I just want to head back to college now, ok? I am wasting precious essential calories here! So MOVE IT! YOU CANCER! GGRRRRR!!!!" "What if I dont?! Are you really going to face me here? What if the people get caught in the crossfire?!" "phfeh! Only idiots need to make such a mess to pack you up! Im gonna do it right now wanna see? WATCH THIS! YOU TOO LUCIA, YOU DOORMAT!" "What the hell did I do?" This is said as the goofy music ceases and Helios from Yakui the Maid starts playing and Ester charges up all her pent up frustration while glowing white as she breathes calmly to get a good feel for her own power so she does not let go too soon. Then she BLITZES AT PSYCH2GO! THE DREADED MONSTER COULD NOT EVEN FOLLOW! AS ESTER STANDS RIGHT IN PSYCH'S FACE, SHE PULLS BACK HER ARM(she is using her psychic powers. Its like she is controlling herself with a remote. That is the essence of psychic powers. They can be visualized as a wave of infinite strings that can be allocated and used at will with limited energy and intensity) WITH FULL FORCE AND RAMS IT THROUGH PSYCH2GO's HEAD SO HARD THE BONES ON HER HAND SHATTERED! BUT SHE ALSO MANAGED TO GET HOLD OF PSYCH2GOS HEAD SEED, ITS MAIN SOURCE OF POWER AND THE ULTIMATE INGREDIENT FOR ITS REGENERATION, AND WITH THE OTHER ARM SHE CHARGES A THROW AND CHUCKS THAT SEED SOOOO HIGH INTO THE AIR! ITS AIRBORN, AS SHE MUSTERS UP ALL HER COURAGE WHILE IGNORING HER PAIN, USING ALL HER POWER TO SQUISH THE SEED WITH COMPRESSED AIR! THERE IS A 15 METER BALL OF COMPRESSED AIR IN THE MIDDLE OF LOURINHÃS MAIN PLAZA AND SHE SQUEEZES AND SQUEEZES AND "WRRAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!" AND IT BLOWS UP! ITS LIKE THUNDER! And the seed.... is gone. She lands in the ground. As psych2go drops dead, she looks at Lucia and is  like: "*tsk*....." and... just walks off! Lucia says "You... have broken bones!! get to a doctor quickly! you ha-"  "I know! I will go there when I feel like it! Now disappear and quit nagging me!" And Ester flies away to the bus station.
