There was this one time when Yakui turned tomoko into a fire type temporarly: And It was ALSO during the ELITE 4 BATTLE! Can you believe that? What shes done was what she considered her masterpiece: She created a faulty genetic level TM for Gyarados, who scientists SWORE could not learn Flamethrower to save her life, that was suposedly for ice beam but instead of that, besides giving Tomoko some, fortunately, benign tumors in her bladder, gave her FLAMETHROWER! But then, after we went to a pokecenter, where she had to spend a whole week at so she could, besides getting the tumors and the faulty TM out of her system, learn how to piss again, she developed antibodies for the virus that Yakui was using to inject dna into Tomoko with and all was... fine.
And I bet she was just like: "Ok... I need to pick a scale from Tomoko to study her antibody generating genes now."


Once yakui was in front of a tentacruel... sleepy and dazed... as the tentacruel starts dealing her massive damage. but because she spent the whole night (It wasnt a marcio induced sleep), experimenting with and... well... self testing her mysterious products (she was UNEVENLY blinking bro! What the hell...)and just moaning as this beast level 40 tentatruel absolutely crushes yakui, who then just says "waaaaah piss of you smelly thingie! Your tentacles are making me itchy! go away waaaaah...." and then throws the mysterious liquid at tentacruel, releasing a virus inside its brain that dug its way out, to then dissolve in water and die. So... her new drug was basically a biological weapon that can completly disintegrate a level 40 tentacruel... ok then... at least she does not have more... right?


Isa, who yakui often asked to purposefully use poison sting on her, calls her 'a Drugtrio'
