Antics with Ester the Venomoth:


She also BEGGED me to fight opponents like 15 levels above her... Logically... she is pretty damn functional. But... emotionally...

Once... she tried taking on a level 60 gengar... and she did it... she had to use sleep power, HOPE it hits... it hit. Then SPAM double teams... while gengar sleeps... she did it. Then... after the third double team, gengar woke up and put her on 2hp with a nightshade. Then... I have Ester an option: "Ester. Another one of those and you will be taking yellow sirup to your veins in a bed in a white flourescent room. Scram... or gamble on a sleep powder. Youve already got away with enough to prove yourself to me. Ester: "No. I wanna finish that bastard!" have it your way then..." Then Ester gambled on using sleep powder again... AFTER Double team took its effect and she dodged a nightshade that would put her to sleep for good. Then... she use psybeam! While gengar was asleep... aaaannnd... it got it to 4/3 of health. Then, while gengar was asleep... Ester used a psybeam... and another one... and another one.... and another one.... another... another... How gengar is not waking up is a miracle right now... and another one.... and they were all super effective. But then... ester took it down with a leech life.
But then Ester ran behind my back after defeating it... shaking and crying
