Stories of Ester helping the team catch pokemon: "
First... HOPE, the zapdos: 

With special grade strategic insight, mediocre speed and mediocre attack power... she used her sleep powder, got hit hard before it took effect... then tomoko use her icebeam... the gyrados needed... 3 of them... 3 of them. then the zapdos took her out in 1 thunder shot. then... I used my last potion to heal her. Then I Pulled Ester out again... who got hit hard... again after using sleep powder... then I threw an ultra ball... it clicked... once.... twice... thrice... Hes on the team now. Thanks to her, he is on the team ok? In the honour of all the effort Tomoko and Ester put in, Ive named the Zapdos... "HOPE".


then...: RESILIENCE, the Moltres
*We go through the cave* Ok... see? hes right there, lighting up the place. Ester... sneak on it and dip it in sleep powder, got it?* *We approach the legendary bird... Ester... flying stealthly... her specialty... approaches... In one motion she dumps a third of her pp in sleep powder on the bird and, with a desperate look on her face that would look comical in any other situation, she flutters away, scrambling in haste out of the reach of the bird. Tomoko then moves ahead, summoning a huge wave and dowsing it in water using surf. It took a heavy hit from that. I try to chuck an ultraball at it immediatly... hoping I get lucky. It escapes... and wakes up! Then... I decide to switch to maria, and use mega drain on Moltres... barely denting its vitality. Maria then dips away giving way to Ester, who was now in charge of putting it to sleep again. With new found resolve, she is about to dump as much sleep powder as she can on the bird, but then it catches Ester... starting to grapple with her and twisting our Venomoth... using firespin. It keeps going... and going... and going... and going... but then Moltres decides to release Ester. Ester uses sleep powder again. This time... it really is asleep. But... as soon as I switch to Maria again... it wakes up, wrapping maria in a firespin. it keeps going... and going... So I send Leyla over. "Leyla! use mega punch!" leyla: "Its a flying type dumbass!" "Do as I say!" Leyla, then musters up her frail psychic physical strength and drives her hand hard through the birds chest... with picture perfect technique leyla: "Like this?" Leyla says... slightly confused by my strategy... not noticing Moltres now on its knees. I send ester over AGAIN, who gets caught by the bird in another fire spin... that lasts... and lasts... and lasts... leaving Ester literally gasping for sensation on her body as now she is a blow of hair away from death... she musters up strength and dips ALL her poison powder on moltres... "Stay.... stay.... stay....." Ester mutters. I then yell "GOOD JOB! RUN!" Ester crawls away... to somewhere... not looking back. I throw 1 ball... it escapes... another... it escapes.... but at the poetic third one... it... stayed. WE have... caught Moltres. its name will be... "RESILIENCE".
