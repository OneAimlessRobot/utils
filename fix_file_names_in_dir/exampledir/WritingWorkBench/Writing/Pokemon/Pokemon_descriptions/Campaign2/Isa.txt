Then... there is Isa, the Nidoking. Isa is self assured and practical like HOPE... but it enjoys teasing and getting under the skin of other pokemon, teamates and opponents alike. It is ground/poison. Isa is a bit of a wildcard, as she got taught... rock slide, which is rather normal, but then it also knows blizzard. Opponents using dragons may expect and easy picking, but if Isa, who is also surprisingly fast, can get on shot on em with Blizzard, is instant lights out. She also knows earthquake. And besides that she has Horn Attack she uses to finish opponents off. Isa was diagnosed with Moncissism, yet, after some adversity of its own, managed to get a better grip on her naturally difficult personality. It also enjoys promoting the personal growth of humans and pokemon alike, albeit in a more tough love sort of fashion. It works really hard, is independent, focused and straightforward. Also... sharp witted and has lots of friends all over the place, Like Beth, the elderly Lapras that she calls when she needs a watery taxi, as many flying pokemon refuse to carry It. She grinded to level 51 without Misters orientation. With some remnants of its difficult personality left, enjoys throwing its achievments at other pokemon and people's faces to invalidate them. it is currently level 51. Mister has a maxima for Isa: It does NOT fight Slowbros.

this is Isa, the nidoking.
