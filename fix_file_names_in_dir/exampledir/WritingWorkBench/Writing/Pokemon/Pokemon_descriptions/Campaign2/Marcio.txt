Then there is Marcio... the Vileplume. Marcio is a very sluggish, sleepy, unbothered and low output grass/Poison type pokemon that did not really socialize, banter, rally up the team or get affected by rally ups, he was not the most brilliant or  quickest, but the sheer mental and physical resilience of him were out of this world. He once got hit by a NASTY rock throw from a graveller at victory road, getting him down to 20% hp, but he then... not even looking at his opponent, replied... by just... yawning to then put him to sleep with sleep powder and then uttering to Mister: "Mister... he is asleep now... can I also be asleep too?". Marcio also completly deleted the whole trainer population just after cinnabar island, after we switch trained him for a while. Marcio spents is out of battle/training time napping, listening to music, journaling about his day and... thats it really. His journals reveal lots of his inner world, of someone who does not really like to self enforce or assert but suddently found himself in a pokemon battle team as one of its main pillars. "I cant even tell day from night most of the time and then suddently theres another battle... I dont know... whatever... Ill just battle then". Marcio can take lots of punishment and is used as our main hit taker, having taken an ember from a level 50 charizard, in the face, being left with only 2 hp remaining, to then just... mildly moan and put the dragonite to sleep right after, following it up with a devastating solar beam that had enough force to ko it, to then... just utter to the opposition, in a whinny, yet soft tone: "Next time dont wake me up... I get grumpy.... waaaaahhhhhhhhh..." The final moveset of this Sleepy flower head was Mega Drain, solar beam, sleep powder and toxic.
