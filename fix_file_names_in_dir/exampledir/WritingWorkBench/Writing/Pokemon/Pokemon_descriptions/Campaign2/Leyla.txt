Then... there is Leyla, the Kadabra. Leyla is a ungodly gifted, unnapolagetic, not very serious even when under immense pressure, sharp witted and humor loving, although lazy, technology addicted and potetial wasting psychic type pokemon who always seems to have way too much on its plate that what she deserves. She loves instagram, pokemon gossip, banter and to spend sometimes up to 7 consecutive hours browsing on her phone instead of training. Remind you: She is the only pokemon in the roster that isnt Maria that can learn dig, which would make her completly unstopabble, yet she refuses to even attempt it, prefering to look up new memes on reddit to send Mister and the team. One can say she is Chronline, a bit of the 2007 internet blogger stereotype, who does not really respect her own potential. Ester does not really like Leyla. This NEET ass pokemon knows psychic, psybeam, megapunch and rest. Leylas worst attribute is her physical attack stat. But... if unprompted, she will ALWAYS use megapunch as a first blow, although it almost never achieves anything meaningful, when she could have just solved the problem by evaporating the opponent with her nuke level psychic attacks.
Ester: "Leyla! Get off the phone you degenerate! This is training you disrespectful Bitch! You really sicken me... WHY ARE YOU NOT TRYING TO LEARN DIG LIKE MISTER TOLD YOU, HUH?"
Leyla: "Chill Ester! Psychics have virtually no counters! Ghost pokemon cant touch me and bug pokemon are weak as hell! No point!"
Ester: "Dont you ever feel ashamed of how easly things come for you Leyla? You piss me off..."
Leyla: "Not really... its not my fault... As long as I can look at youtube I can live just fine..."
She is currently level 51

This is Leyla the kadabra.
