Then... there is hope... the Zapdos. "HOPE" (In all caps so its understandable), Is a self assured, flying/electric type pokemon that was caught by Esters team in a powerplant near cerulan. They went through a war to get it. Yet it quickly found its place both in the background, with its conforting and stable presence, ocasional logical and practical insights, knack for helping Ester and Mister plan for battles, by finding weaknesses in their more theoretical approach. It is fast and, most importantly, possesses the thunder move, taught to it a day later after being caught. Its style is careful and watched out... akin to a sharp shooter. it only uses its thunder when its really necessary. It is a resourceful, practical thinker, always with its head directly above its chest, not above the clouds. Its feathers are pointy and hurt on touch. It hurts to hug... besides thunder, it knows drill peck and thundershock, that it uses to finish off weak opponents. it is currently level  50. Mister also uses it as one of his 3 "Brute force damage crammers" when out of options for an opposing pokemon.

that is HOPE the zapdos.
