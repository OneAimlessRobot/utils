Then... there is Caleb, the ratticate. Caleb is a very impulsive, very bratty and whinny, yet compassionate, supportive and hardworking normal type that was used by Mister as a normal type sweeper. He was under immense pressure throughout the whole way, and was spec built to take out psychic pokemon early in the game. The whole team all had to help him learn Hyper Fang, at level 14 and then evolve into ratticate, at level 21, if I recall correctly. But then it was wraps for everyone during the period until the mid to late game. No one stood a chance against Calebs powerful hyperfang, with which he struck his opponents down visciously as revenge for all the self doubt he experience during the grinding period. Drowsies, kadabras... it did not matter. Everyone check out after a single hyper fang from caleb, my assigned sniper rifle. His only problem, though... was lack of PP. But, as soon as he evolved into ratticate, before we found yakui, hunched over in her lab built out of mud in the digglet cave, He was unquestionably 100% the strongest pokemon in my team in terms of raw damage output numbers alone. But then Yakui took his place... poor Caleb just did not know yet... After we slowly came to the conclusion that Caleb, although socially a lively bloke of a pokemon in the backstage, with a knack for pranks and banter, while also being honestly very juvenile and troublesome, after all we had been through, and after KOing Yakui when he caught her drugging his potions, we had to release him. Yakui missed him the most as the genius then dugtrio saw him as the only person who could match her hardcore banter. Caleb frequently rallied up the whole team after battles and went blow for blow with garys ratticate at SS Anne, being at just 1 level above, out smarting it and taking it down swiftly. His final moveset was Hyperfang, quick attack, tackle and tail whip. But... at level 26, he was released to never be forgotten.
