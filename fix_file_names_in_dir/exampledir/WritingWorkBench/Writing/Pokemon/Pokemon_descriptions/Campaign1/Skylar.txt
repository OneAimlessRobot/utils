Then... there is Skylar, the Pigeotto. Pigeotto is a very down to earth, laid back, self assured, yet measuably focused flying type pokemon. It enjoys flying, feeling the breezes  flush past his feathers at ludicrous speeds, raining down on opponents fast, feeling his beak pierce the enemy. Skylar is fairly smart, decently quick with one draw back: No flying type moves. Skylar was used alot in the early game to sand-attack opponents and to sweep the bird catchers' metapods, caterpies, etc. It got string shot so much it became funny... as he always outsped opponents anyway. Skylar, unfortunately, quickly became obsolete and just kept being used as an HM slave for fly for most of his time, yet... outside of battles, he bantered with the rest of the team and kept them all united, like social glue. Skylar enjoys using pokemon fitting sun glasses when not battling and talk to the lady wild pokemon that we encounter. He helped a wounded ratata by flying it to the poke center. And one more important thing: Skylar, deep down... does not... really like fighting. He went out of use for good when he was level 23.
At that time, he knew gust, fly, sand attack and quick attack.

That is Skylar... the Pigeotto.
