Beatriz is a level 50 articuno. She was diagnosed at a Poke sock jail screening center with Pokeopathy and was tested in a PokeIQ of about 179. After we caught Beatriz... and asked her to join she... said she was... "kinda bored anyway" And, as long as she did not have to fight, she would fly us anywhere. We dont ask her to fight unless we want her to. She scares us.


that is Beatriz the Articuno
