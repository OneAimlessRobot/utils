Journal of Ester the venomoth goes here:


Some ups and downs at trying to beat the Elite 4:
"
*Me, Mister and my pokemon team... we failed again... it was not anyones fault... all of us were simply... too weak. We are at the pokemon center. All of our opponents outleveled us by at least 15 in every battle... all of them... were suposed to be too much for us. But we beat a total of 20  55+ level pokemon... where the max of our levels is our HOPE Zapdos... Filipa... the feisty and confident Hitmonchan... who plowed through the ice pokemon almost all by herself... was in shambles... Maria was inconsolable... Tomoko did not want to look at anyones face... Tomoko, the gregarious and protective soul of a gyrados that she is... was the last one to go out. Ester had to take out an exceggutor almost all by herself... which was 16 levels above her... putting it to sleep multiple times... using multiple psy beams... But none of it was enough... I sit besides Ester... at the pokecenter*


*Another Ester antic later...* Leyla... impatient: "Omg... did that degenerate graveler really have to use explosion? really? Explosion? Why would you use Explosion? And did Ester really have to take on the degenerate graveler to begin with?" Ester... weakened, at the pokemon center, after getting knocked out by said graveler: "B- But... if the sleep powder had hit, it would be... asleep right now... also... you... you would have gotten knocked out too!"

*A more sucessfull day today... Ester got to level 49. And took out alot of pokemon* Ester: "Mister! Mister! Im sorry for saying this... but... I really like leech life... when zubats appeared... I just used zubats's blood to get some hp back and then managed to keep going! I will really miss leech life... Im sorry if saying this is stupid though..." Mister: "Ester, thats understandable. Love is created through shared adversity. and god do you love leech life... but I have to be realistic with you: The Elite 4 dont use weak ass zubats... instead of healing... Psychic will just instantly knock out most pokemon... are you aware of this?"
