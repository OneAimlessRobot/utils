Title: Dorei the Maid: Pathetic Creatures (Straight, but credited, youtube reupload with anime thumbnail. I have no musical talent.)
Desc: Sigh... I did not have such a good day, you know? Its always been the same since I got out of college... I have no actual friends, my old High School peers see me as nothing but a mere annoying inconvenience, all days are the same, all the days... are definitely days though... with 24 hours, a day, a night... job... eating... bathroom and sleeping. Its pretty cool! Ive also not got.... uhhhhh.... a..... a.... b...... bo-....... boy-.... boyfrie-.....-nd yet too.... Its fine... lifes pretty good! Job... games... patients... reports... anime... ya... its... ful...filling. Im only 17 too soo... thats cool... Im... proud of.. myself, yes. Its... cool. Psychiatrist position too... my own office... Those bastards in Highschool are campers. Those bastards in college are dumb. My parents eat solid DooDoo and my patients are allways absolute, pathetic losers. Do you know those campers in Call Of Duty? You know... Like... those that dont memorize the maps and just stay in the same spot during whole rounds, not moving... They just stay zoomed in to the same fucking ladder or window the whole game. Its like they are. Fucking. Autistic! You get in their face and they immediatly start shooting everywhere... except me, of course, like junk fucking robots! You move like two centimeters and they take like 2 seconds to realize it! And then, they realize it and then you move aga- like theyre fucking dumb! Theyre so damn Stupid! Pathetic bags of cake stuffing! All they do is consume glucose. Thats all they are for! They are the tunnel vision retard generation. Like... They all choose a life where they only want one thing and they are so hyperfixated and urrrgggnnn!!! Theyre like bacteria in a petri dish! They bump into another bacteria, dodge. Bump into another. Dodge. Bump. Dodge. Dumb! Grrrrhnnn!!!! And they are so pathetic! You tell them the shit you are suposed to say and they are like: "Ohhhh.... Thanks! That is soooo smart!" No its not! Youre just super retarded! Why dont you buy a better brain? I heard they sell those on the black market nowdays... you should check one out, you slimmy, slug, grime producing thingy! One with actual wrinkles on it, too! They shoot like  3/4 of their clip into space and then realize i am like 8 degrees to their left it pisses me off! Its the same for my parents, my highschool peers, my college professors (Uuurrrggggghhhhhnnnn!!!!.Their vapid yapping makes me want to fucking blow up! They are the absolute worst!), my college peers are like crash test dummies! Theyre on their way to that, at least, with the trash they eat and drink all fucking day... fucking degenerates... and then they end up in my office where I have to yap about the same shit over. And over. And over again! Imagine being such a loser that you need ALCOHOL in any way, like, full stop! Imagine needing it at all! And you know what? God should launch an update! Like... tear all this shit appart and rebuild it from scratch. All the npcs use bethesda AI anyway... And the other half. DOES. NOT. WANT. TO. BE. HERE!
I feel like the therapist when the credit card declines and they are a black buffalo calf that ended up suddently alone and faced with a lion because they were coincidentally good at math.

Title: Akui the maid: SATA ANDAGI (Reupload with anime picture)
Desc: I stand in my office. its almost 6pm. The sun rains down, orange and green, down the metalic shutters into the small cubicle. I am in my computer... just looking at the desktop wallpaper and zoning out... I am calm. The day went well. I feel seratonin and sleepy. I bought a new maid attire I can wear on my way home... wow... im 17... im a professional therapist with a salary... that can still show a maid costume to her parents... and its totally normal... No clients left for today. I can leave at any moment now but... Im just... thinking. 20 more minutes go by, and I decide to leave. I greet everybody on my way out, like always, trying not to look at the people on the waiting room... as they scare the s*** out of me... then... AAHHH... OUTSIDE! Like... the light... the calm winds, the sweet taste in my throat... the people bantering... feeling like... I could just join them... My tiny body, my tiny cat ears on my sports bag... I can go to a public restroom and change myself! My taste for anime cannot be HELD BACK ANY LONGER! I RUSH TO A CAB AND CHANGE MYSELF! Ahhhh... its... black, and pink, AND IT HAS PINK AND BLACK CAT EARS! I also got black lip stick, cat like make up... and eye liner. AND IM OUTSIDE! I CRASH IT OPEN And... people... look at me. I stop moving. Look at all of them... turning my body slowly and... scrutinously... with my hands on my hips and bending over slightly. Then... bend back. cross my arms at my chest. Then... smile. I start laughing. Looking down on them. They are still looking at them by the way... I then put on a calm face and... slowly put on a relaxed standing stance... with the costume... the black and pink cat ears, the white apron, my petite body... And... raise my arm. Do the metal handshake sign. "Get on my level." I say... and then... leave. Then... As I feel the pure hype getting into my body, as the fulfillment sinks In, I start slowly walking faster and faster... then running... faster, faster, faster, faster faster faster. Until I feel the wind rushing into my face, me clumsingly dodging people, with... the dress, the apron and the cat ears. I have no highheels because thats for idiots. Dont wear that.. youre gonna fall on your butt idiot! I have kickass chinese shop sneakers my mom bought me when I was 13! Im not really a grower. *smirks mischiveously and arrogantly* Im... a shower! IM THE RED HOT BLAZING BULLET FAST ROCKET THERAPIST THAT HAILS FROM TORRES VEDRAS AND WEIGHTS LIKE A CHIWAWA! I also have a lot of judgy energy... and I am blunt and... omg fuck that! the wind on my face... its so good! Its so good to run fast... to dodge people, to be annoying! To have cat ears, a white apron and a black dress... I then jump from a ledge... time seems to slow down. My arms are hanging horizontally backwards, my but is bent back backwards, my legs are forward and my face is leaning way forward too. FORWARD! FORWARD! FORWARD! I WAS MADE TO RUN FORWARD! MOVE MOVE MOVE! REACT! STRESS! CORTISOL! DOPAMINE! I WAS MADE TO FEEL! ALIVE! ADVERSITY AND THRILL! NOT CONFORT AND SADNESS! NOT MELANCHOLY! ANGER! I am Leonor. I feel. I judge. And I am almost, always correct. own it.
