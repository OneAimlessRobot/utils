Title: Ethanol.
Desc. Copium. I need copium. Im spent, Im stressed and Im battered and its time to knock on the devils door once again for some of his stuff. The world teased me, then it mocked me, then it humiliated me. Then it beat me to a pulp. And now... ethanol, like the tears in my face, coarses through my body triggering me, leaving me a broken mess. the ethanol you buy at pharmacies now cleanses me and my body. This thing is good! because it works. It makes the neurosis go away, all the unhealthy feelings of paranoia and anxiety. the bitch comfort one needs to survive should not be underestimated. should not be mocked. the stuff I already saw in my life... my roommate naked with muscles during an Fe grip and while  I am an INTP with body dysmorphia, Me seeing some exhibitionist walking the residence without a shirt on and trying in futility to cut it out because he is an Fi dom... and then... he was not the only one. so, the next day, I roasted them and roasted them hard. I called them naga, browny (from pakistan), willy nilly, exhibitionist weirdos. and the worst part is... when I got to my hometown, my house was empty, but still feeled like a visitor. I dont wanna exist anymore
