Title: Redemption
Desc: As I roam the world struggling to validate my own existence, both myself and others, and as my psychiatrist yells at me, I feel relieved as she acuses me of incompetance at life instead of monstrousness. I am not a monster. I AM NOT A MONSTER! I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT! FILIPA DOES NOT THINK THAT! I am just... a... a firefly! who instantly turns to nothing once forgotten, but capable of outshining any star in the night sky until then! I am a good person and allways will be! I will never give up. They can hate! I wont care! and neither should I! I cant melt the sun like Filipa, im nothing but a weak wax candle next to her, but I only managed to
get this far by stubburnly going against the rule that narcissists deserve forgiveness! I wont give up! I WONT!


Type: Musical Single
Genre: Rap with breakcore beat
Title: Stride faster to compensate for the slow suffering.
Desc: "Get to your destinations without hesitation! Breathe well, conserve energy for every sprint. Never doubt yourself. Move forward. Weakness is just hesitant strength! Pure strength comes from embracing that you are not a fiend! And that you are just an incompetent retard who obviously does not do things well! Just do the job! And just correct it if you fail! Be apathetic of your success! Because it is merely all thats expected of you!  Life is purely math! If it is not, then you are all wrong! Specially for you, Ester!" Thank you, Deolinda.

Type: Musical Single
Genre: I have no idea. 
Title: Hopefully until I die, I grasp one spec of  Filipa's wisdom
Desc: Filipa, I know you wont forgive me... Ive been trying so hard... I can already lift normal children weights at the gym! And can walk for 15 minutes without collapsing! I feel overall better. I still tried to kill myself this week... twice... and failing too mutch will still give me too mutch confidence... but that also applies to everything else. But thats weak talk! I failed my PT who is proud of me! I failed that kind man who helps me raise my weights when tweaking over toddler loads as a 20's year old. I failed! Im getting a feeling suicide attempting will become an addiction... but hopelessness will just make it more certain I fail... to survive... whatever what you call the highway pileup that is my emotions right now, he he!... he he!... And... you still dont see me? Are you trying to get me to give up? NO! YOU WEAKLING! SHE IS RIGHT! YOU DESERVE ALL OF THIS! YOU DESERVE ALL THE DESPAIR! All the weak lives pass through trials... to be brought to real life again! Beat the monster. No. Crack the puzzle! And move on! But... is it bad... that you, stubburnly or not, still ignore me?

Title: Chikoi the Maid - Leaving the Reality (vocal cover)
Desc: This piece is for the doubters. Those that say: "You are fake! You did nothing! You re sitting on your ass making it all up." People also doubted garreth bale. I just have to put you in your place! because I even left my real identity behind! I am remaking myself right now. My old expectations changed, I am no longer a cheater or a blood thirsty, pretty looking, disgusting moth, a vermin of a paranoid silverfish wandering around a magical soul's livelyhood! I did everything I did not do before! And will forever keep going, until I obtain the humanity that God never wanted me to have! I am now... beyond good and evil! Struggle and convenience! Darkness and light! So... am I done? Heck no!

Genre: Maidcore (as me)
Title: Silverfish
Desc: I wander around a magical soul's livelyhood, sucking on all the wood, doing slow and insignificant damage. I am the princess of evil, who needs a bench to reach the seat of the throne. I walk on 6 legs, the two remaining being the delicate balance of guilt and arrogance. I am now a drug lab's lackey. And  how low above ground  my lab is frustrates me. I need to sneak from my lab past 4 flights of stairs with security cams to get to cracking-myself-in-half heights, for crying out loud! Small animals really do not have any fall damage... If they are not even strong enough to climb that high... The white walls look at me, the smell of colorfull, artificial liquids breaks into my throat... The flourescent lighting bakes me alive! I am brainrotting myself on purpose working here! Is it punishment? I dont know... I miss and need  more color! I am a prisioner plotting for my escape everyday.
Not my best one I know. I will be better. Dont really like to channel the feeling of being a spineless insect, but hope you liked it. Until next time, if I survive until next time...
