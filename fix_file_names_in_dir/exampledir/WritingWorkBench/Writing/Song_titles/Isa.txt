I feel millions of tiny legs all over


Title: I miss you all.
Type: Musical Single
Genre: Piano with vocals.
Desc: I am Isa Fonseca, the girl that sold herself as a delicacy for evil. This big girl that injects dissolves clonidine into her veins before an exam. the bitchy bully broken girl that goes after shiny lights inside the pit of dark darkness. I got my eyes on the prize no longer. longing for genuine affection since.before I could choose, I dream of a day where all gods children can be happy. happy as a knife to gods tightrope many walk. But I miss you mom and dad. I miss being dads metaphorical punching bag and mothers roast benchmark. Tough love? addiction to validation in a nation where the guilty are only the ones that wield knives. I am dead in search of meaning....just a filthy, rotten piece of shit.But I dont care how shitty I am, or how many people I hurt or how many hurt me. I want to go back to how it all was before... saviouring the last bits of happiness I left on the plate. Refracting through me... my emotions are, feeling them, I still do. Adriano, my crush once told me: Remember: Isa, Its not insecurity. Its real life. And you cant ever faulter if you also dont even bother. But... They still matter ... I still miss them... This is not a cry for help. Im gonna do it this time. Its currently 9pm. I have the knife on my left... the water glass and pills on my right... I just have to choose... they told me I need to be more open minded. So thats what I did. Anyway I do it, its always gonna be lights out at 11pm. 11pm EST, friday, 16 august 2017. Good bye, everyone. Take care.
