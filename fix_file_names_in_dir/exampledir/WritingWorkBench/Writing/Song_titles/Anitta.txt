These are my songs. I like them because they are mine <3


Type: Musical Single
Title: I cant be sure (Alexander perls cover)
Genre: smooth singing and atmospheric guitar thing... dont really know did not look it up sorry...
Desc: You cant be sure.... of the waves that break on the sea. You cant be sure... of the winds that blow down the trees.
Is this all because of me?.... I cant be sure... of the starts banged in the sky.... I cant be sure... if tomorrow... the sun will even rise... I cant be sure... the look you show in your eyes.... Will I know... before... I die?
I dont know... if only your... touch could save me... tonight... we cant be right... losing sight... of all the other ways... tonight
Were out of time, your open eyes... are they looking back in time? Can I ask you please? in midst of this? If we really are alone... tonight? We shoot out of cannons... and just hope we land? Our parents... can they accept me? Can society just... discard losers? losers with feelings, emotions, hopes, even if vague or innarticulable? Even if my chess is weak, can my singing make me heard? Even if my food goes bad... can the trees give me apples?
