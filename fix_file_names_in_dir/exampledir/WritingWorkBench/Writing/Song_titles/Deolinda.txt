Desc: So... they sent this to me a few days ago... it was actually a band one of my patients belongs to who made this... I thought it was pretty interesting... *chucles* cute even... So... here is the vibe of it, as described by a art critic friend of mine: "*Deep... breath...* Ok... so... what brought you here? hmmHmm... hmmHmm... Oh? hmmmHmmm... Ok so... I can already tell... we are compatible. Our session has potential... for... results. I already know sorta whats going on. *Overall... what ends up happening is a mix... of demanding... understanding... barely enough force to nudge us. Pushing us into evolving... outgrowing ourselves... outpacing, out maneuvering... realizing faster... and faster... integrating... going... and going... forward... forward... forward... "This should be easy and expected to understand by now... right?" one... always barely grasps it... always... just barely. "How much to you want this? Your friends? Do you think they should be waiting this long? Im glad you had a reason for this happening... otherwise... we might to think of a completly different approach... I cant have patients hogging like this... like a camper in the battlefield sipping on coffee... while their peers are throwing their bodies into the cyclone of metal shards that awaits them... You should participate... you should realize! realize faster! think! Think! Reach deep down and outgrow your own corpse self! Evolve... everyday a new person. I want change... I dont want to wait... You can cry... everyone can cry... and you should cry... You should... because crying is pain from pent up frustration. Frustration at your shackles... it should be expected and easy for you to realise... it always should... If you need help, go get it... you must not slack in my presence... I will press your buttons... until you give... and if you barely give... and still resist... I will let you go scott free... so you should watch for buttons to press... And I dont want exausted people in my sessions either... so if you are exausted, scram and dont waste my time... so... cry... I may also hug you... and... and after crying all that you have... The train will... accelerate... as this new integrated part of yourself will make you faster... you shall move forward... you shall carve... you shall eat through the flesh made of the tissue of society... untill you finally insert yourself... in a place where you can grow, until you expand and people... begin to flock to you... after you have flocked to other peoples aid for so long... it will be cathardic... you will become even stronger... You will then grow a spine... you will go from lettuce to carrot... when Im the one taking care of you... So... now get out there... and... help other people insert."
