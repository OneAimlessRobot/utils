Desc: (I LOVE FEMTANYL) As I sleep on my dark room with no paint, light of any sort and only a vibrator to keep myself company, along with knives given to me for me to engrave as I pass the time, I feel no time at all pass by. Stasis and degradation of the mind, combined with the shivers from the cold, rough, untreated concrete bounding surfaces of the desolated cubicle. There is a light switch, but Im too dazed off on brain rot and emotional burnout to bother finding it. In my mind, I dream of a place far away, a place where people #letgirlshavefun.... #godforbidgirlsdoanything... My femtanyl and nicotine are in short supply, so is the supply of my will to care for my miserable life. I dream with this knife, every night... or day... or evening... whenever they bring me my ration, in my next mission as one of Beatriz's top dogs, feeling this knife... across someones frame... someones cartilage... soft and milky and slightly plasticy... the bones... I scrape against them because they are hard... the meat... sometimes it gets stuck if the muscle is very tough... its like... a mixture of very fine and tightly woven ropes.. that are sorta elastic... the organs are soft... you almost dont feel them... yes... I love my engraved 'NAVALHA'... its so... delicious... feeling the pressure and the feedback... licking it... to get some nutrients... I spend entire months only being fed chocolate bars anyway... whats the worry in some innocent post murder blood? it scrapes... As I scrape the back of their ribcage, with my trusty 'Seniorita', Omg... its stuck! GRRRRAAAAHHH! There! Its out. So is the poor loser I just picked apart! The muscles... I wish muscles were softer... they require so much effort! I dont like the muscles... Anyways... So... yes, Doctor. No. Dont change my prescription. I am ok.

Desc: So... I just found out... apparently... 5 seconds ago... that girls have a gender gap on men or something! So... My boss beatriz said I needed to kill everyone! Because... the gender gap monster was gonna eat all the money beatriz had for me! And then I would not get my daily chocolate bar anymore! I would starve! But that would reeealllly suck! So... the solution she told me, was to kill a man that was... idk what he was doing... for me it just looked like he was reading his news paper on his balcony... but apparently it was one of Davids teachers! And beatriz told me we need to harrass Davids loved ones for... some reason... like BRO! SORRY! I GIVE UP! I DONT KEEP UP, OK? I DONT REMEMBER! I hope Beatriz doesnt read this and think I was not paying attention... she would make me starve for sure! I dont know... she seems so friendly... its hard to imagine her do that... but I like killing so whatever. I sneak into the inside of his wire fence! I climb on the roof stealthly! There is no way I will sneak up without shedding metal. So... I have to use my silenced tranq guns. Apparently, the teacher is a wuss because, as soon as he poped is head in, I tranqued him with a bullet to the neck (thats where you shoot tranqs btw... its not the head like normal bullets or the gut like sniper rifles... because the arteries are exposed and stuff... Beatriz taught me that! she is smart...)
Then... I leaped down... silently... I held him gently by his head as he was sleeping and laying down and, then, I slit him up and open. Then... I dragged his corpse into his bath, and he lives alone so... I poured some HF acid and water, but its a weak acid. But that does not matter because the ammount it reduces, it reduces almost ANYTHING! Even if it doesnt do it very deeply. So... a few seconds pass by and realize: I HAVE TO STRIP HIM! GOD IM SOO STUPID! So I strip him and What a relief... a few hours pass and, after making more HF using the instructions Beatriz gave me and like the entire medicine cabinet of his and all his shampoos and hygienic products, hes almost all bones! I can see his heart, his ribs... he kinda looks like a half life zombie... So now... I dont know what to do witht his... And I cant drag him to the coast.... So I buried him and left!

Name: My top 10 picks while working for my BOSS! (2024)
Desc: Top 10! Ok... So... I am chasing this target across the street right?... he knows WAAAAYYYYY too much!!!! beatriz wants him dead, so... also do I! He gets on a scooter and I can feel his terror... I feel my heart pumping at full speed now. I dash in pursuit along the tight, winding alleyways, getting closer and closer as I sprint faster and faster. I leap on him... but end up losing distance. I need to cut him off. So I quickly climb some catwalks and get on top of a building. I start running behind him but he suddently loses me and forgets to look up! Striking time. I climb down, stealthly, get on his piggy back, and carve a heart into his neck, trying my HARDEST to slit his coronary! its soo difficult! its like loose rubber! But with the help of another knife I brought, I managed to do it, using one to chisel the other into his brain tripod. I then hop away to avoid getting blood sprayed on my face and pretty clothes, throw him in a garbage container.... AND THEN GET AWAY!

Desc: ......*As I stand atop my baby boy play thing pathetic loser, he looks up, panting, restrained. Arms? roped up, legs? Roped up. Tied down. Like a worthless worm squirming in behalf of my presence alone.* Sweetie? Him: "Y- Y- yes, m- mommy?" *I then take my engraved knife and swiftly bring it up to his chin, driving it with the blade turned away... gently... so he looks up into my beautiful emerald eyes.* Am I... pretty?

Ohhh... like being tied down like this? Being made my pretty boy toy play thing? My cute little sex toy? Do you? Hmmm?~ Him: "y-Yes. M- Mommy?" *I swing my hair elegantly and bring my face closer to him, at his height level, then embrace my legs and arms around him, nice and tight. He can practically taste my breath and look inside my eyes. They are... possesive, commanding eyes filled with affection, desire and a hint of pride of herself.* Close your eyes. *He closes his eyes* *I start kissing him passionately, with tongue, licking his teeth, his tongue and the top of his mouth.* *He tries to get away, but I keep him there* Him: "Mom-" Shhhhhh.... its okay. lets just keep kissing ok? You taste delicious..." *He blushes and gulps* *I keep kissing him passionately, my fingers trace the outline of the features of his face.* Him, trying to let go: "Mommy!" Yes? Him: "I wanna... I wan... `*pants* *sighs*" Who is a cute baby boy? who is a cute, silly, fun to interact with, colorful and fruity baby boy toy loser play thing? *He almosts loses his mind hearing this description. But he regains composure and stutterly says:* Him: "M-mE! ME!ME! ME! ME! ME!" Good. Now... do you wanna ask something to mommy? Do you? Him: "Y-Yes! P-Please! I Wan- I wan- *his breathing is shallow and uneven... he is right on the edge as I pepper him with kisses as he desperately tries to speak his mind. I wont allow him. I will melt him under my embrace.* Come on! *I pull his hair gently and force him to look up at me.* Speak up... BOY! *He has fear... and desire? In his eyes... He wants to demand, but I wont let him. He is all mine. Intimidated by my tone he makes one last attempt* Him: "Erica! Show me... I wan- na see your..." Come on! *I start nibbling on his ear, which makes him moan softly and causes his breathing to become chaotic. I then... utter in a sultry, seductive and low tone, to his left ear, small gusts of my breath enter his eardrums* Speak up! Are you scared? baby boy... you have to tell me! tell mommy what you want ok? Otherwise its too difficult! *Say this as my hands roam his hips, his sides, his arms, his body under his shirt* Momma wants to help you, you know?.....
