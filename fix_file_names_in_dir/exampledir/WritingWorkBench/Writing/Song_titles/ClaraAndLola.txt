Desc: We start our days off, we eat and then we go out! Then...  Clara: "Me!" Lola: "And Me!" In Unissin: "I... go on an adventure... to find Mr Robot! We go through the city, abandoned fields and buildings, in this hot, spring day still with remnants of morning rain... some schools, some geriatric homes... and then... on a hill... next to a river near the village of machines, we find... Mr Robot! Mr robot is a very very nice robot!" Lola: "Super smart!" Clara: "And friendly!" Unissin: "We love it! its our friend, it plays with us and we laugh at its jokes! And... ask questions... play games... and helps us when we are down! So today.... we found it. We small talked, and after like 5 minutes we started asking the questions: "mr robot! Can you tell us why the sun doesnt just explode already?" Robot looked upset at our question... and confused! But it answered: "There is still alot of time left, my young ones... be good girls, enjoy life and play with me once in a while... a robot life is a lonely one!" We laughed! And then looked at it in awe! Robot is sooooooo smart! Like... of course! It does not just explode when it feels like... Then... as the hours tick by and the sky gets fainter and more orange, we run around it, it lifts us up, and then tells us horror stories... Mr robot knows so much about life! Then... once we are tired and hungry... the 3 of us sit in a circle... talking about our walks of life... our desires... our goals... and then... after the air turns fresh and the sky finally turns black... it leads us to a taxi, where we pay it... and then we go back home! Ready for bed time."
