Im straight from the rural areas! These old ladies cupping my face! These teaches nagging at me! These peers judging me! This psychis assuring me! These docs medicating me! People call me the yapper! yapping with nuance yeah! Nuanced yapper! Now... Sophia... A bully walks in and says: "Nuanced yapper? Nuance? Bro! You dont even feel your feet in the morning!" I then say: "when I was little... they called me the podcast!" Bully: "They call you the what? Some kind of speaker?" Ninjas call me the Nuanced yapper! I once pulled up to some trouble makers and asked: "Why so angry? Why murder?" To which they said: "U not scared? We do it cuz we hate people" I said: "Bro? You hate people? You barely have an identity yet!" They call me the what? They call me the medicated fan! The viber poet! The hyper femboy! And plan to cap all these ninjas running their mouths, asserting my dominance! And I dont care what Im using! This is me and how Ill lose me!
