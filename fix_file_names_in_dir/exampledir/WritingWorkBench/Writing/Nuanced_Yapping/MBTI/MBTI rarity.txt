MBTI rarity.

Self claimed ISFJ: "Is being common bad? Is rarity even real? Or is it a myth?" 

*Being understandibly defensive at stereotypes. I try to soothe them."


Does it matter? Why does it matter? Why do you care? Why do people have so much fixation on rarity? It must be so asphixiating to obcess over that...

Why do I care? Who wants to be generic and basic and common? Not me. Not to mention I honestly don’t feel like I relate to a lot of people. Maybe I’m not even ISFJ. Either way, you don’t need to be so rude. It’s a simple question. It’s obsessed BTW. And no, I’m not obsessed or asphyxiated, thanks for your time.

What? Ok... I expected my post to be a bit tepid and generic. But was it rude? I thought I was being supportive... Because... I can relate alot to that vulnerability... of feeling replaceable for something on which people can debate for hours on wether or not one controls or not (MBTI). I thought I was an ISTJ for a very long time and... the things I read online about ISTJs at the time, on quora and even here on reddit, were genuenly invalidating and offensive. But then... I ignored MBTI for a while, bla bla bla, learned life a bit better, yatta yatta yatta... and realized I had to be an XNTP. But I honestly dont feel any different. just like I have an exotic type of engine no one knows how to work with in general... And thats all it is. Its a type of ego. A systematic categorisation of your hinge between the mask and the depths of your mind. It has so little to do with your worth as a person that its laughable! People who simply think they are ISFJs and stuff get so much unecessary hate! But Im trying to spare you your patience and energy. im trying to be nice to you. to convince you to let go of something so small that It only comes off as 'being a bit odd' in some areas... like... there is other stuff that can 100% compensate for what this stuff offers out there. So remember: Dont worry ok? It wont matter. It. Wont. Matter. Ok? Because no matter the confusion and no matter the uncertainty, life keeps going anyway. And so should you. So let go of that fixation. And be free.
