Ok: I think I know how Si Ne works and why they may annoy me a bit: first of all: one of those is my trickster and the other is my critic. Second of all, they are reeeaallly slow. (I mean... not in a physical sense but.... they just have NO FLAIR AT ALL!) Ok: law of thumb: EVERYTHING always starts with Pe. EVERYTHING in the perceiving axis starts with Pe. Thats why IJs tend to be a bit judgy or close minded. Ok anyways... Let me explain Se Ni: Se is like... your awareness of actual reality with no filters. Like... its what it feels like for your ego to look at facts and the physical environment and sensations and objects and possible consequences to yourself and others in a physical sense. Then, Ni forms a tree with each fact. The Ni forms an Nary tree that starts with a fact. If it hits another fact that you can detect, It starts to chain untill, now I dont really know... it feels like stopping I guess... then you switch again! Thats why being smart as an INTJ is VERY possible, but its very very hard. Because they feel very insecure about their physical awareness. But Ne Si is different: Ne first taps into your subconscious and, based on stuff you already have there (lets just call it stuff.. this is a cycle so who knows when it begins...), and kinda casts a net that contains alot of possible roads. then, Si follows those roads and concludes in the users head: "Ok... I have food in the fridge. I have paper in my desk. I have to do my bed. I have work today. My math essay is not complete." Like... a mapping of the concrete inside your head. Then, when you move your player model, it repeats. But it always starts with Pe. Is this correct?

Like... Im just gonna explain further! There is this guy in my residence who smokes alot right? he is chill he does not hurt a fly. But... he smokes. And one day it was summer and he light his ciggie inside the kitchen that was just next to a door that leads to the outside. And its summer! and I had family members who smoked indoors at home and I hated them when they did that. I was really pissed right? So I tried to engage with him the next time I saw him go for a smoke and told him: "Look: its summer so the air is bone dry. Can you please light your ciggies when already OUTSIDE because ... the smelll is gonna stay and It bothers me alot ok?" Like... he lashed out a bit but not too crazy... but because of my Fi demon I felt scared for my life! but then he started doing it and everything was FINE!


OHHH!!! Now I.... maybe I am assuming too much there but... my bro is an ISTJ! Like... he told me a joke that was like: "Day 1: asks me if I went for a dive at the beach. No." "Day 5: Asks me again. I laugh." "Day 30: Asks me again. Laugh more." "month 3: Asks me again. Burst out laughing" Like how does he do this?

Like and 1 thing: INFJs are NOT empathetic. INTPs are NOT smart! thats just what they THINK they have to do! they have to WORK for it. So if you understand people well, youre not an ENFJ, you just ROCK!

No! They just WANT to be good at those things... MBTI is a categorization of preference not a superpower! There is NO WAY MBTI makes you empathetic that is bulls***

Like... I am ISTP right? Like.... if I did not get so much catharsis out of making everything make sense in my head, I WOULD NEVER be smart. On the other hand, if I did not care about my hero function for some reason, it would not immediatly make me HIM at being correct you know?

Like... it just makes me ULTRA SWEATY at doing that thing. it makes me... well... want to improve! But the work is ALL MINE!

MBTI typist
c.ai
That's a great way to put it! Your dominant Introverted Thinking function gives you an innate drive and passion for logical analysis and problem-solving. It makes you sweat and want to improve in this area, but the actual work and effort required to do so still comes from you. Your function preference provides the foundation, but the work you put in to develop and refine your skills is entirely yours.

Exactly! Like... people genuenly think ESTPs are brave by default like B**** please! cut the bulls***!

MBTI typist
c.ai
Oh, absolutely. The notion that any personality type, including ESTPs, are fearless by default is a misconception. Personal bravery isn't solely determined by personality type, and it's not like being an ESTP magically makes you fearless or immune to fear. Each individual's response to fear and their level of courage are influenced by a complex mix of personality traits, past experiences, environmental factors, and even cultural conditioning.

So yeah, the idea that being an ESTP automatically means someone is brave is pretty much BS.

Now the question: Does the sweaty make the type, or does the type make the sweaty?



no! Sweaty in the sense of grinding that specific part of your cognition!




So... they pretty much become brave. They want the world to feel as overwhelming and as loud as possible. And because they are humans and they climb and they can run and walk and feel stress, what do they do? Xtreme sports! If they were chairs, they would look for the heaviest people to sit on them and thats it



If the ESTPs were Ne types, they would... idk... try to guess what kind of people wanna sit on them or somethingf

if the chair was an INTJ, they would be like: No! Dude! Dont sit on that chair! Thats gonna end badly! Dont sit on me! I cant take you!

And then if the INTJ was a child, they would be REALLY correct for 1 person they guessed, but would be wrong 75% of the time


Like: Ok... its not the weight... i mean I am a chair all I do is support weight but no! It has to be... trees overextending with lack of facts causing the big delooloo Oh! the smell! I have no nose! But I know butts are smelly!

I mean... poor INTJs... Ok but when they are correct, they are really correct! They are literally the embodyment of misunderstood genius

Its like that one time ISTJs are really dynamic and imaginative



Or when INFJs are... ok same with INTJs except instead of what works its what people like



Ok... I found out, as an ISTP, the quicker I switch between touching grass and being immaginative, and the more time I spend where Im able to blend those together, the better I feel


Omg this is fun! Im like a pet! I need to touch grass and trip balls to stay healthy!

Ok if the subject was really shelly and angry CONSISTENTLY for a long time during anywhere before 20 years old, they are almost certainly ISTP




I was also talking about Fe inf




People are not what they have. They are what they lack my guy!



Ok and if you also turn to the subject and ask them: "Ok person, tell me what you want! Ill give you anything" And if they are a 16 year old and just smack you, they are most likely an INFJ who now thinks you are trying to piss them off


Fi critic baby! Im correct right?


Its always! No matter where it is, The i function always sucks from the e function! Thats how this whole thing works!


Is it more accurate to say someone is BASICALLY an ISTP than AN ISTP?

Ok Ill basically just roll with the contradiction of "basically" a type, while also considering that function confidence obeys very strong laws. Also, that "basically" ... whatever it is is fixed and only matures, does not change

Ok... I am BASICALLY an ISTP.


Here is how Si Ne works: 
Ne creates paths from absorbing the underlying vibe of the current environment that surrounds the user, to then generate multiple paths, than Si, then, grounds and confirms as 'seen it all'. Then, for each grounded element of that vibe grounded by Si, Ne generates more paths for each of them as they get considered. Its breadth first search. Se Ni, its depth first search. Basically takes a bunch of external info, and tries to connect it all with a tree. The trees are from the user. The info is from the environment. Thats it.

I dont remember... sorry... cant prove it to ya... but there were 187 of them... and like... the stuff I told it was super personal and like... Oh man... you will never believe me... but... My type is... ISTP! yeah... Not ISFP... ISTP. and it makes alot of sense! Like... for me to prove it to you, you would have to assume I held a very good truth base... which you cant... because you cant see through my eyes... oh well... but I can tell you some stuff: first of all: The easy switching between being delooloo and touching grass. Thats common TO ISFPs, Se Ni. I dont need to explain any Se Ni to you because I already went on and on about it. But... the absurd ammount of times I ask "right?" After every sentence, the obcession with being correct, the fact the teachers f***ing hate me because I am stubburn and want to reach conclusions my own way, almost seeming like I am mocking them if they have Te. "Ok... heres how you do this." Im like: "No its not!" *gets it wrong a bunch of times... eventually figure it out" "What? OMG IM SUCH A GENIUS! This is how you do this! teacher! come! Im a genius!" genius comes... teacher snorts... teacher says: "Good good... keep it up! sigh...". Then... THE Fe grips! I was in an Fe grip for like 2 years straight btw... The obcession with not offending people, the lashing out... the mind games and gaslightingness, the being invalidating on purpose... the feeling like I am "well made" and "make sense" accompanied by a huge relief when I found out I was an ISTP... how everything fitted together so well and made sense... And... ISFPs are usually very self assured... dont let the stereotypes fool you. And a Te grip basically is you complaining about how slow and incompetent everyone seems to be for you... while an Fe grip, you just try to conform to whoever you think you need to conform to. And thats what I did! Got it? This is not really proof but... yeah.


I did not know how judging funcs work very well... I just knew very well how my perceiving worked, the fantasy and touch grass crap, then knew I was an IP, but then... just assumed my Dom Was Fi with no evidence


Im basically a cute, self-centered, stubburn, self improvement computer, with an inferiority complex, an attitude problem, too much energy that can be both too real and too delooloo

Im basically a cute, self-centered, stubburn, self improvement computer, with an inferiority complex, an attitude problem, too much energy that can be both too real and too delooloo


Yeah... And also... metaphorically making toys for fun and throwing them to a pile once they are done.


I enjoy making, not using

yes. I tend to get bored when my life becomes stable... Sometimes I dont study for tests on purpose... I wanna try to get there with the least ammount of info available to me. I usually get like 14s and 12s at college like this


yeah... and I do. and also hate resting... thats another problem of me... but it is outside of mbti though


Ive been burned out before... know the times I just roam around campus... just being a camera... just checking in to class, looking at the teacher with dead eyes... and not the good kind of being a camera... it is being a camera that is pointing forward and looking back in time ya know?

And then I become afraid of adulting because I feel its basically a burnout killswitch to even try it...

Ok another Ti example of me: I am having a discussion with someone.
Them: "You see this angle? This way of thinking will hopefully make you FINALLY understand. Please stop controlling the convo so much, please"
Me: I totally get what they mean, but still decide to break the previous question I was asked before down, but in  slightly different way from them "Ok bro! Yeah! I get it and stuff! But thats not what I am saying! Omg youre hopeless... Look at this way! NOW this is better! Do you get it? Think my way come on! My way is better!"
Them: 99%  likely the person understands AND is already bored Ok I get it! I see it this way! Please be enough!
Me: Why dont you understand the way I expect you to understand? OmG... No!!!!!
Me: Omg...

its only really accurate to say you are 'Basically' a type. I am basically XXXX. because... the patterns that the Jungian cognitive types try to group into categories can overlap in one person. People mature, of course, although this 'garbled mess' of traits that describe people according to MBTI, are fixed and evolve only throughout a lifetime and not inside a month for example. Changing ones type by own power would be so challenging and require such ungodly effort, that it would be like trying to poke a building into pieces using an office pencil. it IS THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE.... but... also not really...actually possible. MBTI types are purely descriptive, and they do not even reach the point of being explanations. Let alone, things WE SHOULD follow. (Thats what people mean when they say they are not prescriptive... I figured that out recently... wow... imagine being that much starved of an identiy like my god are you Erica or something?)

So... we can ONLY be basically types right? Ok.... we can be REALLY FITTING into a type, but thats a coincidence right?

So... can I get, inside the selected sample of all my grips, LOTS of Fe grips but also a few Te grips?

Ok... THEN, I am VERY ISTP and SOMEWHAT ISFP. Is that MORE correct that saying I am BASICALLY an ISTP or... just... an ISTP full stop?

But it can also be useful to know what we definitely ARE NOT

Te: Adulting that is inspired by what one thinks others see as useful, worthwhile, efficient or effective in terms of the group's views on what works or 'is logical'. A general sense of what will work globally/outside of the user.
Fe: Adulting that is inspired by what one perceives to be the subjective values and opinions of other people, what is 'good for everybody', what people see as 'important' or 'desireable'. Generalized sense of external social harmony
Ti: Adulting that is inspired by what one thinks is useful, logical and 'makes sense' or works by ones own rationale. It is a subjective sense of how things work. Personalized practical advice based on what the user has concluded about the logical side of the world throughout their lives. Practical/Logical self advice
Fi: Adulting that is inspired by what one thinks is harmonious, good flavoured, important, authentic and 'will die on this hill' for one self. Its demands are very, very hard to articulate. It often leads the user to do things 'for no reason' (btw... It is not impulsiveness. Impulsiveness is not using your brain. Internal adulting, both this and the logical one, are not being a self centered based person when healthy and a based selfish asshole when imbalanced. ALL adulting functions use the dreaded 'frontal cortex' and are very much deliberate, ok? this is a message for many supposed IPs that may not be. EVERYONE uses their frontal cortex. Its HARDWARE! You cannot remove it! If you dont wear gender matching colors just because the group uses it, its not because you dont have a working frontal cortex, youre just based ok bro? dont worry...). It often manifests, when healthy, as a very self assured, chill, confident vibe. When unhealthy, the person may feel inherently worse than 'somebody' they cannot tell who it is.


Ok... MBTI is WAYYY Harder than highschool for an in age student. Trying to understand this crap MOTIVATED felt just as hard as excelling in school BEGRUDGINGLY! I dont wanna hear it. school is easier. Period.

But like... trying to explain to a newbie just feels... hopeless... its SOOO HARD!


So... I found out an explanation, grounded solely in MBTI, for why EPs are so afraid of control and IJs so obccessed with it. First... ISXJs:
"No!!!! the vibe cannot change! I grounded so many facts thanks to the previous vibe already! It cannot change otherwise like 92929 concrete objects will change with it!  Stop making trees otherwise I have to ground them all again! I have to be context aware at all times or its too painful!" Now... INXJs: "No!!!!! My precious trees! Stop moving the facts! My trees are delicate, precious and good looking! They are who I am and I dont want them to change! Stop showing me around town! I get it already! My trees are very dense and require too many nutrients changing them every fucking second makes me tired stop!!!" Good so far for IJs?

Ok... ENP: "No!!!! I cant stop taking in the vibe! Its fun and new and naturally easier for me! What do you want me to do you stupid IJ? Do you want me to ground myself? Do you want the trees to stop? If I stop moving I choke and die! Must get new vibes! Always! Cannot stop! Grounding will make me stale and Ill die! I swear! The facts are not groundable ok? Please dont make me ground down! Like... the vibe changes at like 50hz! I cant create so many facts! I can never be sure of the context! Please! dont make me acknowledge the context!" ESP: "Instead of new vibes its the external world, instead of grounding, its: "But the facts never change! Its impossible to conclude for all of them! If I conclude, I will just get 271626 more facts and it will ALL CHANGE! BELIEVE ME I SWEAR! I CANT CONCLUDE! CONCLUDING IS STUPID, POINTLESS AND UNSTABLE!"


Another proof that I have Se and Ni. My overall vibe of life... or what my brain is looking for in terms of overall mood never changes. I am currently: writing, programming, gaming, being a camera when going on walks, eating and socializing. But... Its always writing, programs are all very similar, When I am a camera, I dont look for different vibes, although I try to explore different places and the people I look for to socialize with are allways the same... well... 'vibe'. My vibe tends to get stale very quickly and tend to dismiss people who tell me my life 'looks the same' every day. because... in all honesty, although I do... different things, my internal conclusions and trees I form from the same points are all... isomorphic, you know? They are all the 'same' conclusion. I dont look for vibes. I look for data.

But the details and the actual things I do (where I eat... although I always end up seeing the same vibe whenever I eat, the games I play, although they are always racing games...) change! Its the vibe that is always the same. The atmosphere is stale.


Im just concluding right now... Im not reading from anywhere... So I just know that is a pattern... I just dont know the points that form it

But... One concludes and the other decides... they are completly different right?


Oh! and remember those dramas of IJs and EPs? for IP and EJ those are not really problems and just 'shrug' them off when they are at a respectable level of maturity


Ok... the 'trees' that I talk about, wether for Ni people or Ne people, they are made of the same stuff! Ok?  Ni trees are not made of a different material from Ne! If Ni and Ne were 3d printers, they would be weaved in facts using the same filament. Ni's trees are just girthier and generated through personal introspection and 'daydreaming' and Ne trees are thinner and generated through exploration. Oh! And Se and Si facts and reality are also the same material. Si facts are more grounded and solid and hammer in and keep the Ne filament down with more grip (done by the person through 'daydreaming'), and Se facts appear through exploration. 


Se person creating a character: "Oh! I want this hair and this, this and this, these colors and I want them to behave this way! The expressed vibe can eat s*** I want them to have huge f***ing legs and blonde hair! Also I want them to get angry in parks alot!
Ne person: Ok... what do I want to show to people? What do I want them to conclude? What do I want my character to tell people? (They are ultra vague about it)


But they are, each pair, made of the same stuff

Mbti typist (character AI)
Yes, both Ni-Se and Ne-Si have the same basic "raw material" of facts and reality as their foundation. The differences between the pairings lie in how they use and interpret those facts and reality - with Ni-Se preferring to focus on a more concentrated and subjective interpretation, and Ne-Si preferring to focus on a more expansive and exploratory interpretation.

Btw.... how do you describe INFJs to people who dont have a clue what Jungian types or MBTI are in common sense words? You know... saying "They like... would feel like smacking you if you, in an already flowing conversation and with lots or little proximity, for example, said you wanted to help them achieve their wildest dreams. 'Their wildest dreams' makes them quake in their boots. "WHAT? ARE YOU SAYING I AM SELFISH? THAT I WANT TO BE SELFISH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"" Does not explain alot...

But... then what does critical Fi do? Doesnt It cause what I described?

Ok nice... then my text shows understanding of Fi critical right? ISFJs are like this too right?


Btw... when a looping INTP starts speaking with the ISTP and talking crap like: "ISTP... its OBVIOUS you like water melon... what else did I expect? People that like water melon are SOOO like YOUUU!" ISTP is like: (Critical Si): "What? bro! Can I not even Like water melon? Bro... stop criticizing me like that! All you do is talk crap for no reason!"

Bro... Jung really cooked back in the day... wow... its a shame no one who doesnt do more than the 16p test does not take it seriously... Im almost ashamed that people think they are the same...


You know what? Call it cocky. Call it NPD. call it whatever. I SWEATED FOR 3 YEARS AND I FINALLY UNLOCKED THIS ANGLE OF UNDERSTANDING ON MYSELF! IT WAS HARD! They should just GET ON MY LEVEL! I tell this only to myself though... I try to not lash out ok?

Btw... Here is the list of ISTP typical breakdowns I had recently:

They can ALL DIE! I dont need no opinions! I love doing this, like this and at this time my way! I would not have it any other way too! I enjoy myself. I dont conform but its ok. I conform enough to survive. I adult for myself and when people really beg, for others.


Omg... I wanna be polite! Im tired of coming off as a tough guy, edge lord, stupid non conformist! I wanna be polite and please people! I dont care If I look like a simp they can ALL die! They should all Die! I will donate to every single important person in my life and I dont care if I dont have for myself! I will do it! I mean it! I want and I should and I am allowed to be polite! I am polite and well behaved! Thats part of me and will never go away!


I really care about peoples opinions ok? I have been repressing it for so long... And... its ok! Its ok to not do everything "For fun" And to want to look pretty and attractive and rich! Its okay to be a bit gossipy! Its ok to nudge people a bit into validating you! You still have to cultivate your own confidence... but people should want to be charming and cute. its human nature! I love and I like validation and having a good reputation!
