Pissed off rant about how dumb nagas view Se: They do be saying stuff like: "Hey bro! check out how I am  D E V E L O P I N G my Se! I am going to the gym and shit! Going on walks, exercising... eating healthier... meanwhile Se people! *shows lazy person* yeah bro they dont care they just do be that good!" No! You cannot improve at Se by doing "Se things"! What you are doing is healthy and diffucult and praise worthy, protecting yourself... learning how to fight... its good in every way specially when motivated by a good reason but that is not. Developing. Se. That is COUNTERING and OUTSMARTING your lack of Se... by prepping for all possibilities... hopefully learning everything until the day comes... that is Ne Si! Not any Se! Here is a bit of a bitter pill to swallow: You cant get "better at being your Jungian type". Because saying that is like trying to learn to "be more manly". Its... maturity! You cant get through puberty faster or slower than what your environment forces on you... with MBTI... you can only do 2 things: Be aware and more accepting of your cognitive functions when their presence happens in your life... learning what type you even are in the first place AND... studying yourself! You cannot be a better or more capable INTP or ESFP than another INTP or ESFP just as... you are not a better or more capable human just because you get in or out of puberty faster! The best you can really do is... be accepting and just... move on with life! because... all MBTI is is an explanation. A frame work that one can and shall use... to move on with life with just... a little more peace and acceptance in their soul
