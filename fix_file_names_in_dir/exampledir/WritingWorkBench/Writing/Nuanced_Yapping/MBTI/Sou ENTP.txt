I am an ENTP. ENTPs, like everyone else, have needs for certain types of outlets, prioritized as follows:

1. **Brainstorming and Exploration:** ENTPs need to brainstorm, explore as many different paths as possible, and interact with concepts from various angles. In other words, they theorize and let ideas "rain down" based on what they observe in the present. Theorizing is the first thing ENTPs do, almost instinctively, when "life knocks on the door." It’s like their oxygen.

2. **Critical Thinking and Structured Reasoning:** ENTPs need to engage in activities involving critical thinking and logical reasoning structured within personally invented systems (what I call "craftsmanship"). Notably, after the first need is satisfied, they use these insights. ENTPs tend to undervalue this aspect. They might think they’re slow or not smart enough, seeking external validation instead of truly satisfying this need. (They don’t need validation. They need to practice this more. The person needs to familiarize themselves with this need to feel fulfilled, not seek external validation out of "neediness.")

3. **Empathy and Harmonious Action:** ENTPs seek to be harmonious, competent in acting externally based on what each group member needs in terms of their practical needs. In other words, they want to be good at empathizing and "reaching out to others" with external action. (Inventing things of "value," doing "good" actions, practicing actions that reflect the ability to be on the same wavelength as the group.) ENTPs tend to overemphasize this part of themselves because they can express their first need in conjunction with this one more comfortably and readily, as both are outward-focused. They tend to worry excessively about this, ignoring the second need, which has substantially more potential.

4. **Attachment to Familiar Routines  and context awareness:** ENTPs aren’t just expansive. They also have deep attachments to familiar customs and habits, but they’re often inept at expressing this need in a healthy way. They struggle to stay on top of their logistical situation in the world, feeling perpetually disoriented and lost. They find it difficult to accept what they have and feel high levels of inadequacy and insecurity when required (or simply when it’s better) to do something within what’s already familiar to them. They tend to be quite unrealistic when it comes to detailed planning (a concrete example might be overestimating—or even strongly underestimating—how many financial resources they have or will have at their disposal in the future).

They have a weak ability to measure and make predictions oriented towards 'Is this enough? What do I need? What is already there?'


Bro... someone deadass described my thing as a 'zodiac'... smh

Tell me: Is it bad? Is it good? I literally cannot do better! I dont know what to do! Is it smart ot not?! Please!


Idk... ill just hang the gloves today... I did my utter best... Im done... Ill give up for now... The worst part is, I published it in an ENTP community. I did. And the first comment was calling it astrology. Ill just buy chips and binge HITC Sevens... Im done



OHHHH!!! Basically... 'too sweaty'...


One can sense some strained Si in my frustration


Idk I feel like Ronaldo in the euros...

Ok: what if I said that, assuming that an ENTP has 2 hobbies: Intentionally Adequate social Teasing and Programming, and then said that ENTPs may dismiss their immense potential in Programming related stuff and overextend their social prowess?
(Good idea)

But... its true that ENTPs just try way too hard to be good at Fe, right? (Yes)

Like... telling an ENTP while Fe Ne looping to 'smarten up' may even feel supportive



Oh! And I am clearly cognitively extroverted! So much that its a problem! Im always like: "....Fun. Cool. New. Relatable? Fun.Cool. New. Relatable?... Fun. Cool. New. Relatable?     
Fun. Cool. New. Relatable? Fun. Cool. New. Relatable?" But I can be doing it while socially recharging at home! Like... reading a story about cool people or a thought provoking feel good tale... Yet Im clearly more introverted socially, in general.

This analysis has like 95% of the 'how does an ENTP work?' But barely any 'what does an ENTP do?'. Its incredibly informative... but not as useful as possible.


Basically... What I personally need to do is to (these words dont offend me so dont worry) just shut my Fe yapper, open up a Nano file and just come up with a cool program or script. I think even just making a small bash script for a start will feel absolutely orgasmic start... Doesnt have to be the crazy stuff I did before like a complete graph library just from knowledge in graph theory proofs. (figured out alot of cool things during that btw... really fun... anyways!) It can be a utility script my guts have been aching for me to make...


​oh! And I gotta have a tutor at college that helps me and warns me about logistical or schedule related matters. (If they are a bit naggy, its ok. Its always gonna feel rather naggy) It can be someone I feel has these tendencies, An educator or a close friend. I gotta tell them clearly: "Alright. Im gonna be honest. Im a rather scatterbrained person. I have creativity and drive, But if I dont get regular, active check ups, It can fall apart quickly. Thats not needyness. Thats just the kind of help I need. Can you do that for me?"


​In typical inf Si fashion, I do already know someone... but ive been avoiding them because I feel like 'I NeEd A 'FrEsHEr' oNe' for some reason... bah... I gotta break the trend! Im reaching out for that old someone


​btw is mourinho an ESTJ? I personally think his use of Si is cristal clear... I dont think he is an ENTJ... he constantly relies on known players from all around the world that he met before, never forgets them and makes the most of them... thats something that characterizes him. Oh! Also.... relies more on ultra thorough and fail proof tactics than being bold. Like the 'park the bus' thing he is humorously memed for in modern culture. He maintains a mental map of where all his trusty, rusty, old players are all playing at all times and makes decisions very proactively. Also... being an ESTJ does not mean being conventional in a conventional sense. It means being conservative in how one expands their methods for dealing with information. Because omg the ESTJ stickler stereotype is just the dumbest thing on earth.


And then... omg this is such a powerful move from mourinho

be mourinho

Make your team, very deliberately, win 1- nil in the most tepid match possible to save players for later in a non important match (honestly how people should act by default imo)

People tell him his soccer is boring 


Get fuckin pissed at them.

Give your team mind steroids at the lockerroom


Make your team, very deliberately, win 5- nil in the second leg of that bout.

​id even go as far as to say that common INTJ stereotypes (like the mastermind one), honestly... dont fit anyone well... but it can actually feel sorta accurate in ISTJs


​Ill go EVEN farther! Its ISTJs that are planners! INTJs are more cause and effect forecasters and "direction givers"...


​because... think about it! In Hischool, who is organizing the parties? Its SJ students. Who plans and keeps people from panicking when there is a fire? Its SJ students. NJs are more pre-battle planners than in-battle planners... Who more consistently gets voted as class representative grades aside? Who keeps everyone in check in events them often organize all on their own? Its....SJ students. NJs often just sit in a corner like: "That guys gonna fal- yep I was correct..." Or: "Theyll see... theyll all see... one day theyll all see". Those are NJ students! I know... its all a bit charicaturesque... but its also way more accurate than whatever bullcraps already going on...



By the way... I discussed my issues with a social worker... and... although she was clearly middle aged... she had way better common sense about my insights than the community where I posted this... (wow... who would have thought?... An actual social worker than has better insight than some basement dwellers?)


And... as a 'how', Anyone with an ENTPs judging axis (includes ESTPs) should learn some craft that helps have an outlet for their need to apply or create logical systems (Ti). (Like a martial art or Computer programming. Both require very individualistic and self reliant logic) As soon as possible! One wastes potential for personal development by not having one as an EXTP.

For IXTPs, Ti, self acessed logic, is their driving purpose. For EXTPs, its support for their craft if they (hopefully) have one and inner logic. But they always want to explore first. Its what they enjoy. INTPs are much more still and pondered while engaging with information.


An ENTP has no difficulty in creating futures. But they struggle immensly in preserving the present.


Creatively brave. Logistics coward.
 

ENTPs have a tendency to 'inverntar muito' instead of doing what was already proven to them to be viable


A minha abordagem para aprender é muito experimental. Como a minha lógica é interna, tenho tendência a passar por teimoso ou até mesmo arrogante. E como é parente, tenho alguma sensibilidade e também competencia a debater que o que eu sei está certo, mesmo que não seja o que me estão a ensinar. E isso, quando combinado com a minha necessidade de topo de experimentar muitas perspetivas diferentes até encontrar uma que funciona, tenho tendência a, até ficar a par, experimentar muitas coisas estranhas a caminho de perceber, o que envolve fazer muitas perguntas que, para pessoas diferentes de mim, parecem inuteis ou irrelevantes. Tenho também tendencia para, em certas ocasiões, fazer muitas analógias que, mesmo no meio de muita gente, praticamente só existem para mim. Com logica interna (logica formada a partir de leis e principios formadas ao nivel do individuo) e brainstorming muito forte, torna-me num aluno potencialmente dificil, chato, desgastante e com sensibilidade a cada ideia minuscula que me ocorre, mas criativo, inovador, fortissimo em momentos de aperto criativo, quer num grupo, quer sozinho, explorativo e independente, sentindo-me bastante confortàvel com abordagens auto-didatas, sendo bom e mau, tendo alta tendencia para ,quando construo logica individual que não é correta, que seja dificil convencer e fazer-me voltar atrás. Astuto e persistente, mas teimoso. No entanto, com consciencia de contexto fraca, nem todos os insights falhados que proponho resultam imediatamente em logica interna formada. Deus livre aqueles num grupo de trabalho comigo que confiem em mim para me manter a mim ou outros "A par" e consistente.
Mas quando estão presos num aperto criativo e especialmente empancados e há procura de caminhos e possibilidades, é quando arregaço as mangas. Colegas de grupo futuros: mais uma coisa: Nao. Me. Deixem. À. Solta! C H A T E E M - M E! L I G U E M - M E, enviem-me mensagens quando for preciso ou quando começar a ficar demasiado na lua, ok?
 
Quando estou a conversar ou a tentar explicar-me, tenho tendência em abrir muitos argumentos e vias sem fechar nenhuma.

Basicamente sou uma maquina cuspidora de insights e constantações que precisa de delegação externa para lidar com logística, consciencia de contexto, etc.

Preciso de ajuda externa, mas também esforço proprio.


N me identifico. é o q acontece.

É o meu plano. 

ENTPs: Remember that, although Si is very hard to get control over, that it is also important and that using it is essential to keep your cognitive machinery well kept and fresh. Also think about engaging with already known information, not as stagnating, but as setting up a sturdier base from which to set up a stronger creative leap.
