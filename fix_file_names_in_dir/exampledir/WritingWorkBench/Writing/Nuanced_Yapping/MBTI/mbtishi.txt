So... is it accurate to say that, in MBTI, IJs tend to be organized and judgy, IPs open minded degenerates, EJs are party animal control freaks and EPs perfectionist free spirits?

Is it accurate to say that there is a huge, almost linear, correlation between what perceiving MBTI axis you have and how much you either show or tell?

Id say... any Se Ni type (any), shows WAY more than they tell and the inverse is true for ANY Si Ne type. What mean is... any type that has Se (and therefore Ni) Does that.
Plus... All those types have a rather strong tendency to be "hands on" sorta artists. Wether it is by showing them around the world of forecasting and logic (Ni, Te), Forecasting and social group mediating based outcomes (Ni, Fe), Straight forward leadership (Se, Fi), or Straight forward performing( Se, Ti).


and another thing that I dont think people are ready to accept yet: ESTPs... have a very strong inclination to be socially withdraw. Not awkward... but withdrawn.
Oh! and even when they are good students in conventional school, they BARELY talk. They just wanna absorb... they are not like ENFPs or ENTPs who sit in front of class barraging the teacher with questions
And it also has to do with which perceiving axis each type has
