Figuring out psychic flight


Psychic can fly. Ive described a psychic blast... I mean... the force numerical dimension in newtons (When multiplied by some coefficient for efficiency) Can symbolise, basically, how strong Ester is. So... does she just... eat sardine cans mid flight?

Ok: 314 newtons. she flies... 5m. Lets not assume parabolas... she can tuck her knees and fly foward. WOW! That is not... that many joules...

Also... I know weight adds energy demanding for flying... but... remember! The heavier... the MORE CALORIES A PSYCHIC CAN CARRY! AND DOING EXERCISE AND HAVING MUSCLE DECREASES BIOLOGICAL INNEFICIENCY SHARPLY!!!!

So someone like Filipa, Who rarely used her powers throughout her life, has excellent fitness, has a pure, deliberate, yet ambitious mind, although she would need to make her gland more powerful and practice and fall... ALOT, FILIPA COULD TOTALLY LEARN HOW TO FLY!

Ok... She needs like 314 N's to Stay afloat. But what about... flying at like... 57.6 kph? (right under school ticket speeds)? (Air drag)

Ok. So... to take off, she would do a really relatable thing: Jump! That would give her initial velocity that she would maintain by countering gravity by exerting her exact bodyweight in force upwards... making the resulting force null, keeping her jump speed. she would need some skill (She obiously has), to jump at a speed she can control her ascent at. If she can maintain 314 N's mid flight, she can also do it to ascend.

Lets say pi is 3.2 (It will turn out to be pessimistic for this purpose)
right under ticket speed is 16 meters per second.
Lets assume air density is 1.225 kg/m3 for pessimism. (This is air density at sea level)
Lets assume the shape she forces into the wind is a circle of her head plus the rectangle of her shoulders. (Lets add BOTH) (That is... no overlapping) For pessimism. (and simplicity).
Lets assume that shape has the Cd of a cyclist (0.9).
Her face has a diameter of 26cm. Radius of 13cm. We are assuming her head is a perfect sphere which is not true and is also pessimistic.
Ester is, well... smol. Her shoulders are 5cm wide and 30 cm long. (smol n cute)
Breasts? Dont tell her about it but she has NO CHEST! (So we dont include that).
Total formula is:

(relative velocity to air?...No wind assumed... she would obviously try to fly in tailwind... and would, obviously, not fly in storms... so... lets assume the airmass she travels through is stationary relative to a stop sign in the ground! Its... 28.) (V^2) * airDensity * 0.5 *  * Area * Cd

Which is the force she must CONSTANTLY exert while flying in those conditions.

Area is:

(0.3*0.05)m2 + (pi* headRadius*headRadius)m2 = (0.015 + 0.05408)m2 = (some) 0.065 m2

V is, of course, 16 meters per second.

So... (((16.0)^2)*1.225*0.5*0.065*0.9) N = 91 Newtons

So... in total: 314 Ns + 91 newtons = 425 Newtons.



Btw! If ester is really angry like during the blast attack (forgot her wallet or smth) ive calculated it... and she can fly at 232 kph! Its very draining... let me see for how far


Assuming she brings 6 chocolate bars with her and departs fully replenished: "((1200+230*6)*4184)/(1800)" meters (this is @ her max speed)


Bro imagine being able to sprint for... god knows how long that takes... so... (6000m/64ms)s... 93.75 seconds!

Like... imagine running from the tigers for a minute!

Not my point!!!!! Sprinting at your max human foot speed for  93 seconds!

But that psychic muscle thing can develop seemingly endlessly! Thats the power of psychics! If they ALSO exercise, they will become very powerful! Imagine if ester exercised! Widening those vessels to deliver sugar to the gland!

the max force esters psychic gland can currenty exert PERIOD is 1873 Newtons.

I feel smart... like... is this what people do at BioMech ugrad courses?

Ok. I weigh 60 kg. She could totally fling me right?

Oh! Air drag... ok... we can assume objects become "basically flags" if amxx-admin-grabbed across the air for long distances right?

What i mean is... my body would basically start "straightening up" like a ragdoll with the wind as I get flung

my shouldas are 0.40m by 0.07m. muh face is 0.18m in radius or smth idk its pessimistic so its okeydokey.

​well... the force did not change... so... still... 6km... so... still... wait no! Gotta change stuff! omg im so tired of changing! The 6km become 7 and the 94 secs becomes less than 10. She cant sprint more than 10 seconds... which makes an eerie amount of sense

​but my fant- point still stands! She can fling me!  I mean... not in a weird way ok? In a factual way!


Here is why Ester is terrifying:

Imagine giving a sociopath an I R L  G R A V I T Y  G U N   F R O M  H A L F  L I F E


Bro.


I calculated Esters shoulder width * thicknes + head front area. wrong. its not 0.65m2. Its 0.065m2.
her max speed isnt 232... wanna know what it is?

7hundred... and... 5ty... kph
750 kph dude.

​but my fant- point still stands! She can fling me!  I mean... not in a weird way ok? In a factual way!
