How much energy does a 60kg psychic have to spend to suspend themselves for 1 minute in the air?

Ok: Each second, gravity tries to accelerate them 9.8ms. because, every second, they dont, every second, they exert power by moving in the opposite direction by the same ammount. 60kg is (pessimistically), 600N of force. So... 600N of force... and every second, they "move" @ 9.8 ms. so... 6000 Joules a second. Roughly... 6/4 of a kCal a second ( 3/2) so... 1.5 kcal/s I.E. Nothing important for a psychic, if they get strong enough to exert 600N with their gland, that is... its not very energy demanding... Oh! wait! a whole minute, yes! So... 15 * 60... is like 30 * 30... which is 900... now split by 10 is 90 kCal. Nothing crazy... now. What about a quick friend demonstration? That would be like... 5 secs right? So... 1.5 * 5= 7.5 kCal. 

But such a psychic, Optimistically, would have to exert enough power... inneficiencies aside, to lift themselves in the air with only their gland... like... can you make a hand stand? Thats how hard it is!


Yeah! Flying is pretty reserved for the psychic equivalent of the kinds of fit people that can do LONG duration hand stands... Real sweaty Gs basicaly

Sweaty Gs basically... I can imagine. A youtube video "Flying is easy... you just suck- Improve flying as a psychic - the first 10 meters"

Flying with psychic powers is like doing a hand stand but the strength is directed into the air instead of the ground
