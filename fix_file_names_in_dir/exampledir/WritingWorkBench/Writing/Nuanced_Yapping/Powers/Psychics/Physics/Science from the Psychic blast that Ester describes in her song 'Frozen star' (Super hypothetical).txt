Science from a compressed airball blast.


Ok... so... numbers! there are many equations we will have to use to get anywhere:
1- E = P * V - This relates pressure of air inside the blast with the volume of it.
2- P = F * A - We will use this to relate the surface area of the *blast* with the pressure inside.
3- 1 kcal = 4184 joules (for food lingo)
4- E = 'const' * radius^3 - this relates the energy released by an explosive that can store some constant (in Joules per kg) of energy per unit of mass with the radius of the blast.
5- 1 atmospheric pressure is around 100k Pascal. 
6- the density of air at 1 atm is around 1.225 kg per cubic meter.

Lets begin!

The spherical blast was 1.3m in radius... (the compressed blob itself) (about 28.8 m3 in volume)

And she was compressing it at 7 atm positive diff using her full power (so 8atm)... it is 7* 100k Pa of pressure... 0.7MPa. and the blast was 28.8 cubic meters. so... pressure *vol gives us 20.16MJ of energy.
And... the density of air she was holding above her head was around 7 * 1.225 kg/m3 = 8.575 kg/m3. (Scales with pressure).

sooo... we multiply density by volume and we get 28.8 *8.575= 252 kg of air. And she was compressing that into something that was 28.8m^3 in volume by the way. So... that is (20.16*10^6) divided by 28.8 = 0.7M J/m3.

The blast has a potential radius of cubroot( 28.8*10^6 / 0.7*10^6)= cubroot(41.14) = 3.45

To MUSTER IT, she needed 20.16 MJ of energy... like... less than 5975 kcal! (She could already have about 1000kCal in her puny body. Eat 13 high energy protein bars mid charging and its good! (Also some more to guide the blast and keep it compressed))


 So... lets assume Pi is 3.2. 3.2 times 4 times 1.3 squared is... 6.4 times 2 times 1.69 which is 12.8 times 1.69 which is 21.6 m2 of blob surface area. so... to get 0.7M Pa, *this* is where the crazyness comes in. because... for Ester to compress so much air together... and KEEP IT compressed until the blast reaches the target, she would have to exert, at some point, ((7*10^5)/ 21.6) Newtons which is... like 32407N. And that is like Ester lifting 10x herself... IN EARTH SURFACE GRAVITY

And if we consider that THAT IS THE ENERGY EXERTED ON THE OUTSIDE... which is important because PSYCHIC POWERS ARE NOT EFFICIENT...

SHE... BASICALLY THREW A PSYCHIC SHRAPNEL GRENADE AT A MALL BECAUSE HER MAKE UP WAS WROOONGGGG BROOOO!!!!

Oh! And she was 18.

The way she just... basically THREW HER ENTIRE BODY's WORTH OF CHEMICAL ENERGY INTO THE MALL!

And like... (I know... massive shift in topic but keep up) She is an INTJ. And INTJs are L A Z Y! She must have found subtle ways to optimize her charging... and she was ALSO deeply sociopathic at the time... so there must not really have been any mental barriers involved too!

This is important, because then we can assume the inneficiency in her psychic gland management is really low! Almost like a direct modulation into real world impact!


"Ok: She did not have to hold the weight of the blast because all she was doing was, in concept, driving a fist in a matress. (the mattress suports it). The blast had 3.08m radius. so... something like 9*3.2 front area= 28.8 m2
so....lets assume she made the blast travel there at 5kph. thats 1.4 m/s.
(btw this is the air drag of the blast)
Cd of a sphere is 5.
1.4 squared is like 2.
air density is 1.225.
so... 1.225*0.5*2*28.8*0.5

so... air drag of the blast was 17.64N." <- practically irrelevant

To keep it compressed it was 32407N.

so... for Ester to carry the blast, She would have to have exerted 32407N for a distance of 60 meters (where she was hiding).

32407*60*1 (its airborne. No cos of alpha here)
19444k Joules.
she used up...

464 kCal to do that.


So... all the *destruction* came from letting go all at once? Damn...
