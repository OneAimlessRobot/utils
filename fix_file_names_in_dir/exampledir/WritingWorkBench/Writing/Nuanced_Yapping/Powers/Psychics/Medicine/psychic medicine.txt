Or... watch as the autistic person approaches a stranger they want to socialize with... and then open a tunnel between them and the autist, and then between them and the stranger. and then.. think into the autists brain, uttering something like: 'ok! Ive opened the tunnel between you and the stranger, Mr Albert! You just need to think: "hello! Whats your name? Nice to meet you!"' this helps if the autist cant talk...
