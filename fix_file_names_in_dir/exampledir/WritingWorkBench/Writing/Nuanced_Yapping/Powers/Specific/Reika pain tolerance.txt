Reika's main ability while under physical stress is her gear changing in physical pain tolerance: She is a killer, and because, while being
bred by the staff at the lab, she enjoyed videogames, she called these stages the following, in terms of power potential:
first blood, second strike, multi kill, ultra kill, killing spree and godlike. During the first stage, she kinda just... vibes and rools with it.
during the second, when stuff starts feeling a bit more than a tingle, she detaches from the moment and goes into an ultra abstract
state of reasoning, numbing out any emotions she may catch because of physical pain or sensation. during multi kill, she can control the muscles that contract and
what times to the single muscle level, with very accute precision, numbing out the muscles that she does not need. She can whitstand a few shots from a 9mm like this until she finds a bandage.
during ultra kill, that she developed in her teens, she can cause herself temporary slowdowns in neural transmission, basically delaying her pain responses so she can prepare for them using purely her
reason. She can whitstand the pain of having her fingers snapped off during ultra kill. during killing spree, she enters a pain fueled flow state, that drains copious ammounts of calories but gives her more physical power
the more pain she has to endure. She gets tired very quickly. During godlike, its the same flow state, except she cannot feel any pain. Any pain. At all.
