
Ericas special move? She calls it: Double Dare. its a reference to "Double Team" from the pokemon games... As you all know, Erica is Validation powered. For every bit of attention she perceives to receive from their opponents, the gains in her physical capabilities, already hyper situational awareness, quick wit and visciousness are definitely very real... but... she has a threshold that, if reached... will enable her to take that to a whole another level... upon she decides to use Double Dare, her speed, agility, the speed of muscle twitch AND stamina all increase dramatically for a few seconds. Why a few seconds? Ill get to that. But she becomes capable of dashing at speeds of over 50 kph, turn on a dime like a cheetah, kick so fast her legs leave after images... multiple times in under a quarter of a minute, jump like Nelson Evora and think like a primal hunter, reading movements of opponents almost seeming like she is ordering them around. Her eyes glow red, she gets this viscious smile on her face and... the maniacal and sultry giggling... its all terrifying. Oh! but her then insane calorie consuption rate, if the validation does not stop flowing in, will, again, at the end of a few seconds, straight up make her faint. But... the destruction that she may cause along the way... is boundless in potential.
