Psychic People can have special moves. Special moves not born just for the sake of being special moves. They are a strike or protection or whatever that is used in extreme stress or emotional imbalance. Rage... well integrated or not, Obcession, Sadness... and always has a target and it is always deployed due to negative emotions. 

Ester has Neuroblast. Neuroblast is conjured by Ester by mustering up all of her bodily energy and bringing all her focus to the psychic organ. The psychic organ then, as she focuses... may have to sustain up to 2/3 minutes of non stop high charging, all her accumulated calories start getting consumed... during this time, she also maps out all the targets that will be affected. Then... after all that time... She lets out a 3 second shout, letting out the psychic blast, sending intense beams of energy to all the targets' brains, hoping they are powerful enough to cause serious brain damage, overstimulating and disorienting the target, frying all the neurons in their brains, and even different regions of the brain to contort and shift, causing them to completly lose shape, mush out into pudding and make the victims brains into a random neuron paste. "Imagine... all that you are able to see... the seeming delicate order of it all... just... smashed into nothing". The victims will die 90% of the time. If not, develop some really nasty stuff like dementia and alzheimers. After this, Ester will collapse, under nourished and will then, if not plugged into fluid in an hospital, or fed, or something, have at most 5 days to live until she passes away.

All from a girl... that, in her teens, weighed the same as 2 domestic butane gas cylinders
