
Filipas special move... is more... specific. Its... also... only related to football. Its... the self-pass. Whenever her team is awared a setpiece in their own half, Something that the other teams never quite expect is... what Filipa does when the team decides to award her the honours. 90% of the time, Filipa just sends a long ball to one of the wings and runs to her position like usual. But... what she sometimes does... is outlandish: Know magnus effect right? When a soccerball is kicked using backspin... it kinda floats in the air and the forward speed hogs quite a bit. So... what Filipa does is... get like 2 steps of runway, then kick the ball... REALLY low! Like... straight up kicking the ground. And then... she runs forward... to catch up with the ball! She kicks it! the ball swirling in the air... at ludicrous speed and Filipa... catching up to it below... sometimes running at up to 40 kph to do so... And it works and results in highly dangerous and precarious situations for the opps... because... she can just run that fast! She then catches up... usually when already very near the big box of the opposing team. She usually receives it with her chest... but if she is feeling confident... she once receive it... with... a leg! And... rules speak when another player passes to an offside player. but what if the player that receives it... also passes it? Its very risky... it requires it to be early in the game, for the opponents to be caught off guard when it happens and not tackle her and they have to be too rigid to be unwilling to concede fouls... the only real way to stop her once she gets going, as football players... the last time I checked they cannot fly. Its called "The self Pass". She pulled this off... a total of 6 times too...
