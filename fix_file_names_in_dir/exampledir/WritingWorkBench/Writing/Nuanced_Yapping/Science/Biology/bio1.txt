What I know about cells:

Ok... they are soo cool! They are the building blocks of life, they had a very interesting nuance while evolving: They started multiplying into colonies instead of growing at some point! They could have gotten bigger... but for each time they get bigger, their surface area, which directly correlates with their energy intake, and lets assume they are spheres, does not compensate their energy usage, that directly correlates with their volume! Surface area is whatever radius squared, and volume is whatever radius cubed! So multiplying into multicelular organisms was the best approach! *continues*
