Chase, multi tag.

Its chase tag, but with a twist: Multiple touches matter and everyone is simultaneously chasing and tagging.
Everyone starts with 0 dents. Once someone gets tagged, they get a dent. The game is like a frag based multiplayer game. It ends either when someone reaches the max (therefore worse) number of dents. The person with the least... wins. Or it can be the same, except it is a time limit. Good for middle school kids in between classes. It can even have rounds and stuff.

Sore issue: "how many dents do I have? How many dents do others have?" And you bet your ass those insecure ahh preeteens will lie about and fight because of that
