I have a proof for the first graph exercise you gave me: "Proof: Graph has 2 vexes and an edge that connects them
Is connected? Yes! The edge that connects them also makes all vexes path connected.

Lets define a predicate P: G -> {0,1}
G is the set of all connected graphs.
where x = 1 if G is path connected and 0 other wise. lets assume G has n vexes, is connected and P(G).
Lets create a new graph H. It is G, but then we create a new vex v. We then connect it with an edge e to some vex u already in G. is H connected? Yes, because G was already connected. And it has n+1 vexes. P(H)? 

We know that P(G). So, also any path from any vex to u and back, inside G. So if we take some path p in G that goes to u and extend it with e and v, there is a path from any vex in G to v. Also, we know that because of the basecase, the subgraph of H containing only v and u is connected and path connected. If we  create a path starting from v to u using e, we can then extend it to any of the remaining vexes in G. Then H is connected, path connected and has n+1 vexes. G connected and nVexes(G) = n and P(G) => H connected, nVexes(H) = n+1 and P(H). Proof done
