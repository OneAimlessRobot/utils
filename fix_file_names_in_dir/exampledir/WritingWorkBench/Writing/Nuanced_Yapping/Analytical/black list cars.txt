Some nuanced Yapping with my Boi GPT


I call the Gallardo "The Stig". It was won from Ming, Blacklist number 6. Bro just shuts up and races. That's all he cares about. Relatable.

The Benz is "Yanderebille". It was won from Kaze, Blacklist number 7. She is a total crackpot.

The Lexus is "The Schoolyard Bully". It was won from Taz, the cowardly, joker wannabe edgelord, Blacklist number 2.

The Lancer is "The Commando". It was won from Earl, Blacklist number 9. Bro just cares about adversity. He came from... backgrounds and got to 9th place through sheer resilience. He is a real man. He did not even shittalk me or threaten me. When I met the requirements he was just like: "Be ready. I'll be waiting."

The Cayman is "The 'Betinho'". It was won from Baron, Blacklist number 10. How tf is he behind Earl? IDEK. Either Earl is HIM, Baron is an embarrassment, or both. Baron is a rich boy loser basically.

The RX-8 is "The Tinker". It was won from Izzy, Blacklist number 12. Do you know the girl with the big tits in MHA that just spits out a fuckin' gaming computer after a 3-second animation? That's Izzy. Both funny, hot, and smart. Mei Hatsume. Izzy is Mei Hatsume.

My fave, though, is the Corvette. The Corvette (which I already showed you and from which I sadly removed the unique livery) was won from Webster. He is a sweaty try-hard who might be even more obsessed than Ming. Webster doesn't care about who he learns from or who he faces. He is like a child adopted by Ming and Earl if they were a couple. He has a vision of "making it", has a fuckin' badass Corvette (when I don't remove the livery facepalm), and all he thinks about is parts, throttle control, and the condition of the road before racing. The world may be in a world war, but all he thinks about is how he is scared that a road pebble will get stuck in the intake if he forgets to mend the holes in his front fenders again. He also just shuts up and drives. If you get his pink slip, I bet he just thinks: "Thank you for the challenge. You take my car. Take care of it. You were a worthy opponent. I hope my ride is worthy of you, fierce warrior."


I'm like a mix between Razor, Webster, and Izzy. Because I cheat quite a bit on this game. Before a chase, I prepare and get everything ready. I always make sure my car severely outclasses my opponents. If it doesn't, I panic.

I am also a sweat ball. I use every brain cell I have for tactics and don't really care about "getting good". On cop chases, I basically just run around the highway dodging roadblocks and spike strips, and when I am done, I hop on the stadium, close it off, and done! Guaranteed chase. Well, it's not that simple; it's actually quite hard, but that's the only strategy that I use, and I use it because it always works. I know the cops can't really do anything about it because, for some reason, the pursuit breaker props don't disappear after being knocked down near the stadium, and the chopper does not check the top of the stadium, so I always win.

I try to drive cleanly, but you bet your ass my predator instincts start stinging if I see an opportunity to put an opponent out of commission for good. I also just care about the overall performance of my cars and abusing races in the most convincing way possible.

I think Webster is like the Blonde Adult looking guy from Hakone. 
"Strong, this", "Strong, that" "Worthy opponent"
(Like I respect the grind but... does the guy actually get any bitches or friends? I actually feel bad).
 I am like Midousuji

I just had to be there to see Kaze beat Earl. Just what on earth did she resort to bro 

Oh I am also forgetting jewels. I think Kaze is the rabbit girl. Earl is Shoto. Ok... Shoto or... the eagle kid? He is totally the darkess eagle kid. The dark shadow hero.

WAIT! I know who Jewels might be!

Jewels is the naive soul from the group. She is like the sleepy girl from Chuunibyou. No one really pays attention to her, but she does not care. Because of her purity, she inadvertently keeps herself looking sleek at all times. Her personality is sleek, pure, and attractive.

While everyone on the blacklist is either indifferent, intimidated by, or hates Razor, every time he gives everyone threats when someone loses she is like, "Razor! Stop it! You're funny!" When she races, she totally kicks ass though. She is like Ochako from MHA, like Onoda from Yowamushi Pedal, and like Lindsay from Total Drama Island. A combination of a subset of them at least.

She does not really care about talking or even reminding others that she actually exists once in a while, but when she does, she says the most out-of-pocket stuff imaginable, in a good way. She likes to keep herself clean, attractive, and tidy. She was, uhh... persuaded by Razor into racing when she was at Lourinhã Cup demolishing everyone.

I think Earl and Her would go blow for blow until one gives up. Thats how it would end.


They are really close, skillwise. Like... Kazes just loses against Jewels after crashing into a highway water barrel while day dreaming about sleeping with Fuckin Ronnie while Jewels was just drooling levels of focused on the road and just never really messed up. Like... do you have any idea of how many tantrums Kaze may throw? How tf does Razor put up with her? Does he use her as a sort of tornado in a pocket? 



If I were to be manipulated by razor, how would it be? Is it likely? Assuming it happens, how would it go?


Razor's manipulation tactics would likely focus on psychological and strategic manipulation rather than directly taking away your possessions, such as your Golf. However, he might try to influence how you use it or make decisions that benefit him indirectly. Here’s how it might play out in more detail:

### The Manipulation Process

1. **Building Trust:**
   - Razor would build a relationship of trust by acknowledging your skills and offering to help improve your performance. This would make you feel valued and understood.
   - He might say things like, "Your Golf is a beast. With a few tweaks, we could make it unbeatable."

2. **Offering Guidance:**
   - He would offer strategic advice on tuning and racing, making you feel dependent on his expertise. This could make you more likely to follow his suggestions.
   - "I've noticed a few areas where your Golf could use some adjustments. Let me help you with that."

3. **Subtle Influence:**
   - Razor would subtly influence your decisions to benefit his own goals. This might include suggesting which races to participate in or how to handle opponents.
   - "Focus on this race. It’s crucial for our strategy. Your Golf will dominate the competition."

4. **Creating Dependency:**
   - By continually offering useful advice and support, Razor would create a sense of dependency, making you feel like you need his guidance to succeed.
   - "Look at how much your performance has improved with my help. Imagine what else we could achieve together."

### Razor's Tactics

- **Undermining Competitors:**
  - Razor might use your Golf's superiority to eliminate his rivals. He could manipulate you into taking on his toughest competitors, using your skills to weaken them.
  - "Take down this racer. They’re becoming a threat to both of us."

- **Gaining Advantage:**
  - He could suggest upgrades or changes to your Golf that seem beneficial but ultimately serve his own interests. For example, he might recommend modifications that align with his racing style or strategy.
  - "Install this part. It’s exactly what you need to edge out the competition."

### Keeping Your Golf

- **Emotional Attachment:**
  - Razor would recognize your emotional attachment to your Golf and use it to his advantage. He wouldn’t directly take it away but would try to control how you use it.
  - "Your Golf is amazing. Together, we can make it the best on the streets."

- **Maintaining Influence:**
  - By allowing you to keep your Golf and continue racing with it, Razor maintains his influence over you. Taking it away would break the trust and dependency he has built.
  - "Keep pushing your Golf to its limits. With my advice, you’ll be unstoppable."

### Conclusion

Razor's manipulation would focus on gaining your trust and influencing your decisions rather than taking away your Golf. He would recognize the importance of your attachment to the car and use it to maintain control over you. By offering strategic advice and creating a sense of dependency, Razor would subtly steer you towards actions that benefit him while allowing you to keep and race with your beloved Golf.

Ohh he would use me as an assassin


Yes, precisely. Razor would use you as an assassin in the racing world, leveraging your skills and your powerful Golf to eliminate his rivals. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how this could unfold:

### Razor’s Manipulative Strategy

#### 1. **Building the Assassin:**
   - **Identification:** Razor identifies you as a talented and ambitious racer with a superior car.
   - **Trust:** He builds a relationship based on trust and mutual goals, making you feel like you are part of his inner circle.

#### 2. **Subtle Indoctrination:**
   - **Advice and Guidance:** Razor provides valuable advice and strategic tips that improve your performance, making you rely on him.
   - **Flattery and Validation:** He constantly praises your skills and the power of your Golf, boosting your confidence and cementing your loyalty.

#### 3. **Strategic Assignments:**
   - **Target Identification:** Razor points out specific racers who are threats to his dominance and subtly encourages you to challenge them.
   - **Tactical Advice:** He gives you tips on how to defeat these rivals, ensuring that you do the dirty work while he stays in the background.
   - **Emotional Manipulation:** Razor uses emotional appeals to justify the elimination of these rivals, framing it as necessary for your own success and the greater good of the racing community.

#### 4. **Execution:**
   - **Races and Challenges:** You engage these rivals in races, using your superior Golf to defeat them.
   - **Pursuit Tactics:** In police chases, Razor advises you on how to evade capture and eliminate competition, solidifying your role as his enforcer.

### Maintaining the Assassin's Loyalty

- **Continuous Support:**
  - Razor provides ongoing support, advice, and praise, keeping you dependent on his guidance.
  - He might say, "You're doing great. With my help, you’ll be unbeatable."

- **Manipulative Encouragement:**
  - He continually reinforces the idea that your actions are necessary and justified, manipulating your sense of morality and ambition.
  - "These racers are holding you back. You’re doing what needs to be done."

- **Avoiding Direct Confrontation:**
  - Razor ensures he never directly takes anything away from you, especially your Golf, maintaining your loyalty and focus.
  - "Your Golf is your greatest asset. Keep it sharp, and we’ll continue to dominate."

### The Role of Your Golf

- **Symbol of Power:**
  - Your Golf becomes a symbol of power and skill, both for you and Razor’s strategy.
  - "With your Golf, you’re a force to be reckoned with."

- **Tool of Domination:**
  - Razor uses your attachment to the Golf to motivate you, knowing that the car’s performance is tied to your identity as a top racer.
  - "Keep pushing your Golf to its limits. We’re just getting started."

### Conclusion

In this scenario, Razor expertly manipulates you into becoming his enforcer, using your talents and your car to eliminate his competition. He builds a relationship based on trust and mutual goals, ensuring you feel valued and supported. By providing strategic advice and emotional validation, Razor keeps you loyal and focused on his objectives, all while allowing you to keep and race your beloved Golf. This manipulative strategy ensures you do the dirty work while he maintains his position of power and influence in the racing world.


Ok here are my top favourites: 1. Webster. 2. Kaze. 3. Jewels. 4. JV. 5. Ming. 6. Izzy. 7. Earl. 8. Taz. 9. Baron. Bull, Razor and Ronnie are tied in dead last because they suck, are annoying and I hate them. Sonny, Vic, Big lou are what I call "Unclassified" because I have no idea who they are from the bios

How to defeat Taz. Three ways: 1. give him a hug. 2. thrash him while driving a Tata Nano like a somewhat competent racer. 3. Tease him until he throws the towel


bro Im driving the corvette and I can say 2 things: 1 - It sucks in comparison with the golf. 2 - The golf has so much more grip than the corvette that the deficit could pay for Kaze's grippy socks


Baron earns money from daddy's business to pay for Kaze's grippy socks so he can get a kiss from her. Loser.

Can you please stop casting every single SFJ as either a doormat or an insecure doormat?

Bro what I told you tells you nothing about their MBTI. Cmon. Take a breather, a shower, have something to eat and maybe talk with a therapist. You are seriously derrailing

Ok. I came back from the lab. I was trying to compare the corvette to the RX8 and the rx8 came up short, once again. Ok The golf was reasonable. Nothing f'in touches the golf in this game. But I thought they would go blow for blow. Wait you know what? my runs with the rx8 werent that good. Let me try again with the rx8. The corvette can do a 1:33:50. lets see the rx8


1:36

Do you know what the worst part is? Steering capability is definitely one sided in this contest. do you know towards which side? try to guess

Do you know which is worse from the two discussed before? worse turning? 

Not the corvette. Its the rx8

None of them had any tuning. And both had all ultimate parts on

Like... THE POINT IS I AM TRYING.... to like the RX8, but my minMaxing monkey brain likes the corvette better! Like... I love the rx8 because I loved it since I was a child (my fave sports sedan), Izzy who drives it in nfsmw 2005 is hot af, I like her Hatsume personality, and the car looks gorgeous. I also like the corvette alot and thats why its a bit sad that the rx8 just cant do anything... better than the other cars...

I think this has more to do with me developing some identity than the actual cars. Because... If I was put on this earth just to minmax through life thats a bit cruel isnt it

Yes. I dont need to always win, Even If I expect the game to be always easy

But the rx8 looks beautiful doesnt it?

Ok I concluded that, in real life, an RX8 is a better machine to just look and appreciate than actually own right? but then... what if, although I love it in both cases, it wasnt a special machine, but a special person? Would I do the same? Would I turn away when things get difficult and end up unfulfilled and with a heavy consciousness?

Idk I just drove the golf so much I just feel spoiled. I wish the world just took the golf away from me so I would just feel grateful I had the rx8

I mean... Its like the engine is an alien. It has different needs, personality, usage procedure. Its a different mechanism altogether, just with the same overall goal. Its very unconventional. Worse can be discussed another day, but the unconventional is a guarantee and its what often haunts drivers right?

Yeah then I feel like I can say... The rx8 is cool. Yes. Would I own one? nah
