She will start, at first, to try to do everything simultaneously.But will learn this will only make the patient confused. Then, she will breakdown and fall into a benign depressive state where she questions her competence. Then, she will learn that its better if she separates both for diffenrent situations. As a side note, this may also mirror her own personal development in a way. Anyway... Then, the patients will start wasting their energies slamming on brakes, turning and accelerating. Slamming, turning, flooring. They will become contanerized, aimless and constantly self critical. Marta will go through another depression. Then, although she hates violence, she starts watching boxing. It goes on for more than 2 years this time. She takes time for herself doing other, less demanding jobs while reflecting. One afternoon, she finds the inventor of the dempsey roll's book on a library. As she checks it out and pages it hastly, she finds one sentence: " To attack or to defend? The first mistake one makes is to assume they are separate. Cant work be fun? Cant free time feel like hell?" It blows her mind. This time, her approach is to execute a system where patients are lead to understand that, although attack and defense are two sides of a coin, two sides of a coin are never separate. The objective will be to, creatively, integrate different aspects of a patients life into the conscious, making it all readly acessible and not blocking anything.
