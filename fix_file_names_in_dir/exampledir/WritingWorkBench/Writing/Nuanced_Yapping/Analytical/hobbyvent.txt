I dont understand. I currently have two hobbies: writing and programming. But... when I am programming, I dont feel like I need to get any recognition from it at all! I made alot of stuff when I was programming. I dont even know how good I am relative to other people, but when I am programming, It sometimes gets so lonely, so real, so personal. Almost... romantic. I know stuff and I dont need to show it to anyone at all ever! I made a http server in C that was ALOT of work! I sometimes spent consecutive DAYS frustrated with it. Same with other projects. But even when I was almost sure that in the next day I was going to "get my ass kicked" by bugs and frustration, I kept going back for more! But with writting, Its... different! If I feel that I just achieved the smallest thing, I immediatly feel that I need to show everyone how brilliant I am. There is no way in hell I am as good of a writer as I am programmer, but I simply dont give a damn if people know how good I am. How can I enjoy writing as much as programming? What is the cause of this? I can also get really personal and locked in whilw writing, but it is like 9 times harder! I can also enjoy what I am writing, but I also need to immediatly show it to everyone... what gives?
