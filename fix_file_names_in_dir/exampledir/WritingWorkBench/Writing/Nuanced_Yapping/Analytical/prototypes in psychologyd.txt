What is something prototypical? Is it like when you boot up a tank battle game for the first time and you look at the tanks and are like: "Where is the tank I saw on cartoons? What is the most "normal" tank?", where the "normal" tank is the prototype?
.....

A prototype is an amalgamation of all the characteristics that are universally recognized in a concept (Something people with aspergers are, for a lack of a better word, "bad" at understanding in other people)  and stereotypes are...?


Then... if through insistent and constant observation I notice that, for example, black people statistically barelh smoke and are hygienic, and also grow muscle without much effort, and then I get confused when I see a frail black person, Is it judgy?



Then....how do stereotypes appear if not from evidence? If they are super specific and derogatory... projection and what else?


So a stereotype can also be a prototype. So, although they intersect they basically dont relate to eachother mechanically, right?
