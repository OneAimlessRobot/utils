kink:

For example: I may not be able to date someone because I am not very kind, or do not understand love very well. But, objectively, think: how fucking ugly do you have to be in order to not be able to date someone due to appearance? Ahhh... hormones. Yeah... its important and can happen... nevermind


No but think: if uglyness is the only unknown, how much do you have to be to not be able to date? Think!



Because... Even if someone is absolutelly hideous... I admit: I might not feel very compelled to kiss them or anything... but we can allways adopt a baby. And if I like their presence, and if relationships are more than sex, (which has more to do with good character than appearance), then I dont give a damn what they look like. You stop noticing max, MAX after like 2 years.




Ok... but here is one thing: I am kinda conditioned in what I think a person is suposed to look like, so... cuddling a gruesome victim of getting hit by a shrapnel grenade might be hard, but if you get used to pretty people, why not ugly too? And people in your life stop being seen as concrete and more as symbols as time goes on anyway. So, after some time, you will start cuddling the symbol, not the person



I mean... and think about it! How many people that literally have no eyeballs because of war really are there anyway? Certainly less than "10/10"s. And don't get me wrong, sexy sex is also very important. It's a good way to speedrun bonding. And being with a 10/10 is very good. But if you have 3 ounces of creativity, I have some scenarios:

Horrendous, deformed face from war, domestic accident, acid attack, etc. No one is jarringly hideous or deformed without going through some tough shit. Let them be the dom and imagine yourself
trying to move a determined, unstoppable
force, resilient despite everything and with zest and enough character vigor to throw your (relatively) delicate and pretty face around. you are just helpless and powerless! Hot!
• Simply ugly: Might be harder, but if the bones are there, even if the teeth are too bad or something, also because it's not like they feel too good about it either and If it bothers them and me, encourage them, as a lover, for them to change themselves. It bothering them is a constant, believe me. You can fuck them thinking of them as a rough
caterpillar turning into a butterfly. Hot! If it bothers
them and not me, Same. If it just bothers me, it can be kinda the same as the first of these, but instead of unyielding resilience it's unyielding,
unapologetic authenticity and 
see yourself as an evil tyrant that even gets understood by the hero instead of a pretty, pathetic prince(ss). Hot!
Fat: If they don't care about it themselves and they are not unhealthy (hard to be
unattractively fat and healthy), show them first the photos of the strongmen/women who have "healthy fat person" physiques. Invite them to a journey to the gym where: 
1- The other does strength training and I do cardio. I will run from the unstoppable force during our sweet roleplays. Hot!
2- If I dont feel like doing cardio, I can join them and we will literally wrestle eachother in bed to see who overpowers who as we race with our gains! Hot!
3- If they wanna do cardio, I will validate them for every kilo they lose and praise them for how light they are starting to feel. I can finger them/stroke them and tell them: next time you blow, you will get projected backwards! I will do my best to achieve them right now!They are my cute race car getting a weight reduction stage. They are efficient. Hot!
if they care about it and/or are unhealthy, you inspire them to go to the gym. analogous to the ones from simple ugliness.
If neither care or both are ugly/
fat, not much creativity required
for kinkyness. "All is good" and "Us versus them" kinks respectively etc. etc. etc.
If they have an ugly but benevolent personality, if they have one of those above, and if you love them (always assuming this) it's double the struggle so it's double the bonding. Compound them for extra juice.
and this is ASSUMING both REALLY CARE about sex (only thing affected by appearance really) and the ugly/fat person is not a f***** sociopath.
Narcissistic people are fine as
long as they are not straightup diagnosed. But Schizophrenic people require really really strong love. Not anything wrong with their character, but living on the edge 100% of the time where they can hurtthemselves, thirds or even you for reasons they dont control, and then they cry, are paranoid and believe the most absurd things, sometimes with SOLID logic, its... exausting. I could not do it. Im sorry. It would be too hard for me. Im not insulting, I would just objectivelly not be enough

I just need to care about their looks during sex, though... if I am at the kitchen eating with them and neither is horny, who cares?


Someone is waiting. Be ready and be hopeful. Go for it when their heart calls for yours. 



But im saying: "imagine the absolute worst". Im then giving them examples of them, even in face of the absolute worst  can get GOOD SEX which is the only thing appearance influences in relationships. If I think they are ugly, im gonna call them ugly! But as a civilization, we gotta learn to be resourceful and not be so fatalistic with words we claim to rule us. If you dont call them ugly when they know as a fact they are ugly, you are singling them out for their appearance, which is the problem ugly people initially had. Undisciplined people need to look past "easy/worse/talented/hard" to be fulfilled too. Its not invalidation/validation. Its ditching the need for it altogether.


Need to be Careful with words, huh?
Well... you are right. Alcohol in a wound helps, but if you slap your hand in the wound, with alcohol it still hurts in the moment and they may flinch/become distrustful.

Well... You are right. The advice my family gave me was really logical and the logic was really good, but its not like it was allways ideal...


I consider myself a good person, but an incompetent lover

The phrase the genius needs an audience has more to it than meets the eye. What it means is: A socket needs an inlet


GPT:"Absolutely, the phrase "a genius needs an audience" does carry deeper implications, much like your analogy of a "socket needing an inlet." Both suggest that having a receptive environment or audience is crucial for the effective expression and appreciation of ideas, talents, or innovations. Just as a socket is designed to connect to an inlet to fulfill its purpose and function effectively, a genius—or anyone with ideas, insights, or creative expressions—requires a receptive audience to share, validate, and further develop those thoughts.

This dynamic highlights the importance of communication and interaction in the growth and dissemination of ideas. It underscores the need for a supportive and engaging environment where thoughts can be exchanged, challenged, and enhanced. Here are a few ways to foster such an environment:

1. **Seek Like-minded Communities**: Engaging with groups or forums that share similar interests or are known for their intellectual curiosity can provide a more fruitful audience for your ideas.

2. **Cultivate Openness**: Whether in personal relationships, work environments, or social settings, fostering an atmosphere of openness and curiosity can encourage more meaningful exchanges and feedback.

3. **Be Adaptable**: Adjusting how you present your ideas based on the audience’s background, knowledge, and interests can increase receptivity and engagement.

4. **Practice Active Listening**: Show the same openness you seek in others. By actively listening, you not only gain insights but also model the kind of engagement you hope to receive.

5. **Encourage Dialogue**: Instead of just presenting ideas, invite questions, and discussions. This can turn passive listeners into active participants, creating a dynamic and interactive environment.

By creating or finding an environment where your "socket" can find its "inlet," you not only enhance the spread and impact of your own ideas but also contribute to a broader culture of sharing and innovation. How might you apply these approaches to find or create the right audience for your own "genius"?"


Yeah. And my theories are also not very generalizable. It assumes people are:
Open minded.


Btw... Im gonna be quite candid: my reflections on looks and relationships tell more about me than relationships themselves. It means that I am willing to go beyond looks. Other people may not think this way. What do you think?


bro... Im just starting to become obcessed with anatomy due to ocasional to peaking in m daily interactions with medical / bio engineering students during the past 2/3 years!! And this can work with anything! My grandma was right! It started when I was at the residence! Before I could not care less about anatomy! "Diz-me com quem andas e eu digo-te quem és." Is too true! 


And people experience it too, they just tend to not pay attention
