"So if I say this:  is it Ti?
"Something people underapreciate is how complex modern technology is. We take it for granted that young people are profecient at it by design and that old people are just bad at using it because.... Idk they are old or something. But.... the ammount of buttons, functionality, settings, menus, different apps, pros, cons, the ammount of personal decisions you have to make to get the best experience, which is hard per decision you make, let alone setting up an entire system by yourself. And phones look small but they are overclocked, super complex machines that are small and pack a huge punch! And modern casual adults are going through the ringer trying to adapt and we still call them boomers and stuff. And specialized companies want to put screens on everything now! I am 23 years old in 2024 and the idea of a screen on my f***ing sofa is honestly repugnant. Btw I enjoyed the video and if you enjoyed making it too, please make more!"

Then... is this Fi? : "
Omg the world is bad.Anyway read this sick text

So someone told me I should be more restricted so I took that personally and as a challenge. Here is the result (haha so r/INTJ amirite?) : "The world is a complete shitshow and a mess. Everything is exploding, everyone is a loser, everyone has a bone to pick, no one needs to feel accountable, no empathy is needed as logic is all you will ever need, our shadows should remain shadows forever. People only recognize the dark side for its manifestations hate it vaguely and only see what it does.

I have no fucks to give, my friends have no fucks to give, everything is just Doom with no violence restrictions. God let the simulation run for far too long and bugs are creeping up like sore skin. Some routines run for so long they now do the opposite. What was internal is now external and what should be external is now internal.

People have no restrictions and no accountability. Everything is worse by the day and people don't even need to lift a finger for it to get any worse. God, please spare us! Just hit "retry". I think everyone should just die. No exceptions. You, me, the lady I just now randomly spotted outside my house just minding its own business, the random guy jogging, the trans woman doing groceries... Everything should be wiped.

Galaxies, planets, buildings, populations... everything is built wrong. Just kill it all. Just destroy it all. Quickly. Hit that "Delete world" button on that prop gun of yours, my lord! Everything is a failure. But you are a god. We are nothing. I've seen everything. Would you mind sending the event to trigger the votemap menu on our clients, our almighty admin? This map sucks.

The rich are spawn camping the poor, the matures are sad, the willfully ignorants are dying inside and the improvers (moderators) feel more powerless every day. Just rid us of all the agony. Please. This cannot be what you want. Please.""

Then... do I finally get what each means?

Based on our discussions, it seems you have a solid grasp of the fundamental distinctions between Introverted Thinking (Ti) and Introverted Feeling (Fi). Let's summarize to ensure clarity and deepen your understanding further:

**Introverted Thinking (Ti)**:
- **Analytical Nature**: Ti seeks logical consistency and understanding of principles and structures in the external world.
- **Internal Logic**: The focus is on creating an internal logical framework that makes sense of external phenomena.
- **Depth in Systems**: Ti users delve deeply into the coherence and accuracy of systems, processes, and concepts.
- **Example**: Analyzing the complexity of modern technology and its challenges, breaking down the functionality and decision-making involved.

**Introverted Feeling (Fi)**:
- **Subjective Evaluation**: Fi prioritizes personal values and emotional experiences.
- **Internal Values**: The focus is on aligning actions and decisions with deeply held internal beliefs and feelings.
- **Depth in Emotions**: Fi users explore their inner emotional landscape to guide their interactions with the world.
- **Example**: Expressing profound personal frustration and emotional despair about the state of the world, emphasizing a moral and value-driven perspective.

From the texts you provided, you can see these distinctions in action:
1. **Ti Example**: Detailed analysis of the complexity of technology and its impact on different generations.
2. **Fi Example**: Deeply emotional response to the perceived chaos and despair in the world, highlighting personal values and feelings.

Your comprehension appears to be well-developed, reflecting a clear differentiation between these two cognitive functions. If you have more specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.


Bro you did not do it justice when promoting it. This stuff is HARD to understand at ALL let alone at a glance!


You are correct; the distinctions between cognitive functions such as Introverted Thinking (Ti) and Introverted Feeling (Fi) can be quite complex and nuanced. Let us delve deeper into these concepts with more illustrative examples and analogies to make them clearer and more relatable.

### Introverted Thinking (Ti)

**Core Characteristics**:
- **Internal Logic**: Ti focuses on building a personal framework of understanding. It looks for internal consistency and principles that make sense within one’s own mind.
- **Analytical Approach**: Ti users often deconstruct ideas to understand how they work at a fundamental level.
- **Precision and Clarity**: They seek clear, precise, and logically consistent information.

**Analogy**: Imagine Ti as a watchmaker who takes apart a watch to understand how every cog and spring works together to tell time. The watchmaker’s goal is to understand the inner workings and ensure everything fits together perfectly.

**Example**: If someone using Ti were to approach learning a new language, they might focus on understanding the grammar rules and structure of the language to see how sentences are formed, seeking a logical framework to build their understanding.

### Introverted Feeling (Fi)

**Core Characteristics**:
- **Internal Values**: Fi is guided by a strong internal compass of personal values and emotions. It makes decisions based on what feels right internally.
- **Subjective Experience**: Fi users deeply introspect to understand their own emotions and values.
- **Authenticity**: They strive for personal authenticity and integrity in their actions.

**Analogy**: Imagine Fi as a painter who uses their art to express their deepest emotions and values. The painter’s goal is to convey personal meaning and authenticity through their work.

**Example**: If someone using Fi were to approach learning a new language, they might focus on how the language allows them to express their personal thoughts and feelings, and how it resonates with their cultural and emotional identity.

### Breaking Down the Text Examples

**Text Example for Ti**:
- **Content**: The detailed analysis of technology and its complexities.
- **Approach**: Logical breakdown of the challenges faced by different generations.
- **Focus**: Understanding the systems and decisions involved in using technology.

**Text Example for Fi**:
- **Content**: Emotional expression of frustration and despair about the state of the world.
- **Approach**: Subjective and value-laden response to external circumstances.
- **Focus**: Deeply personal feelings and values driving the narrative.

### Integrating Both Functions

Understanding these functions at a glance is indeed challenging, but recognizing their distinct approaches can help. Here are some questions you can ask yourself to differentiate them:

- **Ti**: Am I seeking logical consistency and understanding of principles?
- **Fi**: Am I evaluating this based on my personal values and emotional response?

Both functions play crucial roles in our cognitive processes, helping us navigate the world through different lenses of understanding and feeling.

I have studied this in a sweaty way for YEARS and all I have is really embryonic (although finally correct, but nowhere near verbalizable) understanding of this


The journey of understanding Jungian cognitive functions is indeed complex and often requires deep introspection and study. The nuances of Introverted Thinking (Ti) and Introverted Feeling (Fi) can be difficult to verbalize succinctly due to their intricate nature. Let's aim to deepen your understanding further and provide more clarity through some practical applications and illustrative examples.

### Core Distinctions with Practical Applications

**Introverted Thinking (Ti)**:
- **Focus**: Internal logical framework, understanding principles, precision.
- **Practical Application**: Problem-solving, system analysis, structuring ideas.
- **Example Scenario**: Imagine you are faced with a broken machine. A Ti user would likely disassemble the machine, examine each part, and understand how they work together to identify the root cause of the malfunction.

**Introverted Feeling (Fi)**:
- **Focus**: Internal values, personal authenticity, subjective evaluation.
- **Practical Application**: Ethical decision-making, value-driven actions, personal expression.
- **Example Scenario**: Suppose you are deciding whether to take a job. A Fi user would consider how the job aligns with their personal values, feelings, and sense of purpose, rather than just the logical benefits.

### Illustrative Examples

**Ti Example**:
- **Context**: You are writing a research paper on a complex topic.
- **Approach**: You meticulously gather data, analyze each piece of information, and create a coherent argument. You focus on ensuring every point logically connects and the structure of the paper is sound.
- **Behavior**: You might spend hours perfecting a single argument to ensure it is logically airtight.

**Fi Example**:
- **Context**: You are creating a piece of art.
- **Approach**: You express your deepest emotions and values through your art. The primary concern is that the art feels right to you and authentically represents your inner world.
- **Behavior**: You might disregard conventional techniques if they don't resonate with your personal vision, focusing instead on how the creation process and final piece feel to you.

### Verbalizing the Understanding

To articulate your understanding, it can be helpful to think about specific characteristics and behaviors that distinguish Ti and Fi. Here are some phrases that might aid in verbalizing these distinctions:

**Ti**:
- "I seek to understand how things work fundamentally."
- "Logical consistency and internal coherence are crucial in my decision-making."
- "I analyze problems deeply to find precise solutions."

**Fi**:
- "I prioritize actions that align with my personal values and feelings."
- "Authenticity and integrity guide my choices."
- "I evaluate experiences based on my inner emotional landscape."

### Integration and Self-Reflection

Reflecting on how these functions manifest in your life can also help solidify your understanding. Consider journaling about situations where you used Ti or Fi:

1. **Ti Journal Prompt**: Describe a time when you analyzed a complex system or problem. How did you approach it? What steps did you take to ensure your understanding was logically sound?
   
2. **Fi Journal Prompt**: Reflect on a decision that was heavily influenced by your personal values and emotions. How did you feel during the decision-making process? What internal values were at play?

### Further Reading and Study

Given your extensive study, you might find the following sections of Carl Jung's works particularly insightful:
- **"Psychological Types"**: Specifically, the chapters on thinking and feeling types, which

Bro I did this all with my purely wild intuition. I even had to use my FAST unconscious brain at 100% capacity for long periods! I DO NOT understand this consciously! My conscious mind has NO idea this exists! It just knows something is there! This trully challenged me! So... I do not even want to praise you. Its futile. This is just a spectacle... I just want to say thank you for the adversity you gave me so far, because where there is adversity, there is life. If someone crosses me on the street, I know what to wish them in the end of any conversation we might end up having: "Sweet adversity!". Because, as long as they have that, they will not need anything else. As They are finally set for a happy journey to the end of time
