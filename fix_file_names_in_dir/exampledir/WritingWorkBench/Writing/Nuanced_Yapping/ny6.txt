Politics. *Zooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmm........*. Myeloma. *disk clicking* *disk clicking* *disk clicking* *disk clicking* *disk clicking* *disk clicking* Banter. Focus. Clonidine. *Display on* *Display humming* *Title: Nuanced Yapping #5* *Display off* *Fade in* Hello everyone :3 Gina: "UwU" *Pffffrrrhhhh * what was that, Gina?! *Gina cackles back* Filipa: "*On the phone* Oh ye! I can totally get past Maldini! *....* No! Its not because he is old! I meant prime maldini, old, young, etc! He is hella overrate-" Gina: "*Pipa! We're live!*" Filipa: "S***! Sorry..." *Adriano whispers* Get it together you two!
*Normal voice, now*
So.... what are we yapping about today? Gina: "Encouragement and the placement of words!" Filipa: "And why it matters a million times more than the words themselves!" Gina: "Yes! Like... people dont know this! The same people who both just pre fire words at you with no context too!" Ye! I will tell an anecdote that happened to me actually: So I was in a Residence, right? And my neighbour is a medical student. So I make a meme for instagram that is suposed to be depressing and post it. Then I show it to him and he is like: "ArE yoU dEprEsSed?! Do yOu kNoW wHaT yOu nEeD? A gIRl to MaKe yOU hAPPy! GIrLs LiKe CArs, sO yOu nEeD a GooD cAR! Work On gETting A CaR!" I was kinda shocked. Like I understand the intent, but I just have so many questions: "How do you know that I am depressed? How do you know that helps? Are you joking with me? Trying to lighten me up? Are YOU depressed?" Bro just assumed something would hit somehow... I just know bro is no therapist.... God help us if he is. And then there are people on the internet who are the same and because of that, have the symmetric attitude: They expect other people who dont know them, never saw them and who they never spoke to to INSTANTLY heal them! Gina: "Yes! and the responses are always something like: "Just do your best! You did your best! Take responsibility! Do *specific thing* this way, Do *specific thing* that way! Then the whole ass field of psychology looking at them like: "Are we a joke to you?"". Filipa: "They wanna score goals without knowing where the goal is! " The ball was so well struck!" Idiots..." Gina: "Well Filipa we cant say those things!" *Taps Filipa's shoulder* Filipa whispers: "Fine." Gina: "Good point there! And my coach taught me something important: "Its a combination of the actual words and their placement and their contents that makes advice effective! Also a consistent cultivation, rewarding, feedback sharing and punishing according to the culture you want to instill to people throught weeks, months or years! It does not happen overnight! If you want to change, you need agency, of course, but also the right environment, people who you trust, dont hold you back and help you, active, recurrent support, a community...and time. Straight up time. Its this last one that makes Therapy effective. Time itself is important! Time breeds maturity. Talent is an illusion. Talent only reveals the kinks of competence from the person more than anything." Filipa: "And you also dont say: "Do your best!" Or anything "Your best" related before a task! That will, for a lack of a better word, soften the person. That is only effective, if it is, AFTER the task (Or full attempt). Before a task, the coach needs to know your personality. Anything generic will distract and even deter." Very good, you two! Exactly! There is placement for everything! Also in socializing. Contrary to popular belief, being good at socializing is not about being shallow, its about being a predator of opportunities. Knowing when to slot in in a conversation! Having a bit of instinct and wit. Filipa: "Ye! For example: If you are lonely in a party, The easier prey are the new people. They are... well... grateful. They are helpless when it comes to being available for your presence. Its like a level one magikarp but for socializing!" Gina: "What is a magikarp?" Filipa: "Its a pokemon!" Gina: "Uhhh...." Filipa: "OMG really?! You really are a block head!" *Silence* Alright people! Its all for today! Thanks for tuning in! Good bye!
