I dont dislike Healthy Gamer GG ok? I dont. I love the guy. He inspired me during really dark times, he was a fundamental building block inside my inner wellness mind Operating System. I call it "Frozen Star". Dr. K, was the co engineer of Frozen Star. Him and the security Guard Carlos at the residence. Im just endlessly thankful... I just would not be this fine... everything... built on top of what they taught me... Im so eternally gratefull... Hes so inspiring... I relate so much... He pushed me to face so many tough things... I did as much of what he told me as I could... and hes able to open my mind to this day... He thinks clearly, and mixes it up with reason in a way I find both empowering and understanding. I dont think his audience is bad either... I just feel... I am just... I keep holding on to my outcast ego identity... I keep holding on to the belief that I dont belong... what that does is... it makes me choose to not even try. So I dont. I tried to join his discord... and then... the phone number on my samsung was all messed up with my account and stuff... When I realised how much of a hassle it was gonna be, my deep desire to talk to him... combined with my shy belief it was even possible... Just the two of us... no conflict, no proving points... just... thinking and feeling... just guessing and stating facts... sharing experiences... sharing doubts... and I want it to last forever. I want it to last... until I can pay off my gratitude... I dont think any of what he does is bad... Im just... I got banned from the subreddit... because... I was so enthusiastic about sharing my writing... but did it too fast... so now everyone thinks its just spam... then... I got so angry... I felt so rejected... but... I wanna join with them... they dont even know me... they cant possibly remember user names... albeit... I said so many unecessary things... I was harsh intentionally and on purpose to hurt people while wholeheartedly meaning it... hatred... fear mixed with anger... fear of rejection... the regret... Now... Its all over... I will never ever talk to him... the curiosity made of a pure fire inside me... rotting... and dimming inside me... leaving me jaded... more and more... as life goes on... asking... all the time: "Did I really learn... anything? Am I worthy? Can I really move on?" Although I dont want to. I just want to share... everything. The goofy... the adequately deep, my idols... the nijiura maids... Yakui the Maid, my hero... I like Yakui the Maid so much... I feel... I am an artisan... and I must share... please... tell me, god... tell me god... tell me: Did I screw up? Am I doomed to never ever reach out for connections... for the only connections I care about? Because... if I have been holding back on talking to Dr. K, Alok, why should I bother with anyone else? Why should I care? I dont despise others. I... just want Alok. So... many imagined conversations. Imagined overreactive, shallow rants. So many gruesome insults. So many raw expressions of emotion and struggle. So many self idolosing fantasies. Demonstrations of unnapolagetic confidence. So many reflections of deep tranquility. Connection. Through highs and lows... always in my boy/man heart. Always striving for perfection... in your image, Master Alok. Always trying my best... even when I feel like I cant. Even when It feels harsh. I do it anyway. I hold it steady... and slowly... digest, just like you told me. I build confidence. I enhance honesty. Thanks to you found my own way of thinking. So much repressed curiosity... turning me into bitter, spoiled fruit. So much... yearning. So much... untold should-not-be secrets... So much... lonelyness without your attention. I dont know how I should feel without him... Ive always outsourced my values... to someone else... and then I finally found someone who I think I can trust... who I think I can... feel safe around.
