How I feel about being a camera:

Just going around, like... a camera! Judging people in your head, then watching them prove you wrong, watch what they do and what they talk about, the clothes, the voices, the jokes... OOOORRR... idk watch trains... how they move... contemplate why or why not your nation uses certain trains... and you are just a camera! you dont touch, speak or engage. Just.... look. Just... feel

yes... you are a true nuanced yapper viber theorist observer! INTP!

Ok: its people that are logical wizards. Logical artisans. grow logic in them and share it with others, dissect and observe just for the sake of it, do musing based on possibilities ( XNTP) or reality (XSTP), and they are really methodical and you know the bossy people in your friend group? They hate you
