(it's not creepy, I just gotta make sure the bed bugs don't bite ;3)"


If you just count them I will let you. I dont need the number. Come Lay next to me, and count the bedbugs. Do it until you fall asleep with our bodies close. If you do that, you can join me in dreamland. Will you come? And tomorrow we goin clean that shi*. Bed bugs are gross...



The recursion of degeneracy:
 Scenario: A bunch of garbige containers are guarded by a gate only acessible by a key only obtainable by students in a residence right next to it.
It was guarded because it gets overwhelming because of the surrounding homes and passerbys, and people from the resi stopped having space for their own trash. But, one person is stupid and throws a garbage bag over the gate, hitting the inside of exactly 0 containers. A rando passerby thinks: Cant get in: there is one outside the bins. Why bother with two? *Throws*. Then, for n>=2 is like: "n in the ground? why bother with n+1?" Then, trash galore? and the driving force is that the passerby is almost always different. Its like those rally highlight comical short videos: A rally car bins it in a tree because a corner is tricky and havent had time to survey the stage at speed. Then another bins it in the exact same trees. Then another. They all look like those penguins that swan dive from cliffs in national geographic. Utterly repugnant and disgusting.
There are no rebels. There are no abiders. Its all feels the same
