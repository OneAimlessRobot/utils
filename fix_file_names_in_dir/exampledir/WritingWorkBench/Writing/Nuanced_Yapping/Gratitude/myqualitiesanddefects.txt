I am sensitive
I am candid
I am honest
I am open about myself
I am reflective
I am funny
I am refreshing
I am immaginative
I know how to lift myself up
I am curious
I am observant
I laugh at small things

I am arrogant
I think too much and act too little
I care too much about identity
I neglect my responsibilities
I ghost people
I cant gauge threats very well
I am overly individualistic
I am overly secretive
I isolate myself too much
I am hotheaded
I have a hard time moving on
I am blunt but made of styrofoam
I struggle to read myself
