Why do some people look like main characters and others dont? The answer is charm. Charm can be summarized as a high average of the following, according to perception:

1 Intellect
2 Self awareness
3 Confidence
4 Kindness
5 Sense of humor
6 Resilience
7 Straight forwardness
8 Humility
9 Mental zest
10 Candidness

Clarifications:

Straightforwardness can be like: (Carlos): "So... here we are... dark and late at night and your friend is lost and all shops are closed? Also Not in the usual places? Well... we can allways start calling hospitals" Candidness is like: "Look, I know this song means alot to you, but its just so personal that I am never gonna get it like you do. Im sorry, but everytime you show me a song, I dont really care... nor do other people. Saying this feels offensive, but, why dont you keep it... to yourself?"

Confidence has a sweet spot. When starting to feel pushy, shallow, forced or, well, arrogant, it starts to lose points. Its maximum on that grey area between absolute self assuredness and tiny levels of selfish ignorance
