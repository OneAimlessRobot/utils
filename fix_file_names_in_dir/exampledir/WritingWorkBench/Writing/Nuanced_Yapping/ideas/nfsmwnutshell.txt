What is Need for speed: most wanted 2005?
Ok. ur kicking butt on your actual race car for the road. On a street race, your oil tank gets rigged and your engine *BOOOOM* And you lose! They also take your car. There is a list of 15 fuckers who are the baddest mother fuckers around, they do street races and some of them are absolutely insufferable. The top guy took your car after that race, souped it up and is waiting for you at the top. You gotta get through 15 chumps before getting to him, and before each fucker you gotta get enough bounty on you from the police, who track down the bastarts, to impress the sob that is up next. When he stops  ducking you, You two race, you take his car, his girl, his legacy and his pride, and move up to the next guy. The cop chases will get longer, the races harder and the rides you can buy will get sweeter. Thats it. OH! And the volkswagen golf is the best car for some reason
