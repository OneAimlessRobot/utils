Nuanced Yapping 1:

Here we go: I have loser thoughts. I like mushrooms. I get called smart alot. Sk√∂ll. Isa. Deolinda. Neenee. Loser. Jack Dempsey roll combo. Rolls off the tongue... I really wanna do something fun in programming... I really want to. Isa is gone. Gina is here though.. talk to us, Gina! "Hello! Its a pleasure to be here! What are we talking about? Whats up? *What am I?*" What do you do for a living? "I am an aspiring sports scientist and practice mma for a living. I enjoy human anatomy and biology in general. They say its because its a girl thing, but I dont care..." Alright... interesting comment at the end there! What do you think about Neenee? "Neenee is a girl I understand, you know? She makes all this tough act and teases people and acts logical, but its her mask, you know? She is an advocate by nature and is a pretty active person... great human being overall, in my opinion. She also likes fighting so thats like a tip for me. Would buy, metaphorically, of course" Alright... Have you spoke to Filipa? "Who is Filipa?" *LETS GO MAIN CHARACTER SHIT!!!!! LETS KICK ASS!!!!!* Black hair, mewtwo build, talks about sex every waking second. Is loud and clumsy. "OHHHH!!!.... Oh man... that girl is too much she really is not my style. But very straight forward, maybe too much, energetic... all the time and very, very sensitive. Do you know that empathy meme where the person behind a glass full of condensation is drawing the word "empathy" in a way where the people reading see it like if they wrote it themselves? Ok... sorry, sorry, sorry... dont know her that far and was gonna say some shit that may not make sense... she is... very... interesting. Her eyes are... blue... ish? uhhh... yeah! Ok this is an interview but... what do you think of Ester?" You seem to like Ester! "Yeah! I do!" Well... I think she is the ultimate survivor. She counts calories. Literally. She has psychic powers so she can fly. And when deciding to run, walk and take off, she already knows where she wants to go down to the meter! plus the calories plus everything! I think living like that would be torture for literally ANYONE else! She is one of a kind. Gina, before we continue, this is a podcast so not everyone knows what you look like! Give us an overview! "Well... I am 170 cm tall, have a birth mark on my right boob, have purple eyes, my left shin has a scar, a small nose, natural white hair, neutral eyebrows and depending on the training, time of the year, etc. I can  either have built abs or not, built legs or not, and I prioritize striking in fighting training because I have long arms porportionally. I have naturally lightly colored lips!" Whats your bra size? "Hahaaaa!!!! I prefer to keep that private, thank you?" *Filipa comes in* Filipa: "HELLO, BUDDY? WANNA HAVE A RACE?" Gina: "HEY! SHUSH! IM in the middle of something! Go do homework or something! And I already beat you once!" Filipa: "Im done!" Gina: "You're lying..." Filipa: "SHUT UP! YOU ARE LYING! YOU ARE SUCH A BAD FRIEND! HELLO EVRYONE! WHO IS TALKING HERE IS FILIPA, THE BADDEST BITCH ON ALL THE EARTH AND THIS IS MY BEST BUDDY GINA! HER BRA SIZE IS C CUP! MINE IS D CUP THOUGH! I ALSO GOT A NICE ASS! SO IF YOU WANNA TALK TO ME INSTEAD OR EVEN MEET ME IN REAL LIFE, MY PHONE NUMBER IS 9...5.." Gina: "LEAVE, YOU PEST!" Filipa: "Call me!!!!! Bye!!!! Gina is shy so be easy on-" Gina: "*This girls hips are no joke! What do they feed her?! Gotta PUSH!!!* LEAVE!!!!" Anyways! Thats it for today, peeps! We are having technical difficulties!
