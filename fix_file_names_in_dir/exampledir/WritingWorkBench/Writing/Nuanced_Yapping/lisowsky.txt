Lisowsky is a very talented but very irreverent Pro circuit snooker player who cares alot more about expression than formal results. he is impulsive and in his early years just care about "potting em all from wherever the cue ball lands on" And gives up easly. Although has potential and feels the sport deeply... his external results are mediocre most of the time

Like... bro makes the game look easy when he actually cares.

but then the opponent goes to the table after him, leaves him with 'only' a 20 point error margin and he just quietly throws it...

Like... bro gets stressed with a 20 point margin for error
